-From the time of the service of the summons in a civil
action, or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the court
is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control
of all the subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance
of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the sumrnons upon him.

In an action affecting the title to rea.l property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, or at any time afterwards, or whenever a warrant of attachment, under chapter
four, of title ten, of this Code, shall be issued, or at any

is situated, a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties, the object of the action, and
the description of the property in that county affected thereby; and if the action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage,
such notice must be filed twenty days before judgment, and

time of filing only shall the pendency of the action be constructive notice to a purchaser or incumbrancer of the property affected thereby; and every person whose conveyance
or incumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently
recorded, shall be deemed a subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer, and shall be bound by all proceedings taken after

 

the filing of such notice, to the same extent as if he were

made a party to the action. For the purposes of this section, "

an action shall be deemed to be pending from the time of
filing such notice; provided, however, that such notice shall
be of no avail unless it shall be followed by the first publication of the summons on an order therefor, or by the personal
service thereof on a’ defendant within sixty days after such
filing. -And the court in which_ the said action was commenced may, in its discreticm, at any time after the action °
shall besettled, discontinued, or abated, as is provided in '

section number sixty-four, on application of any person
aggrieved, and on good cause shown, and on such notice as
shall be directed or approved by the court, order the notice
authorized by this section to be canceled of record by the
clerk ofany county in whose office the same may have been
iiled or recorded; and such cancellation shall be made by an
indorsement to that effect on the margin of the record, which

§ll6.—Pleadlngs to be subscribed and veriiied

Every pleading in a court of record, must be subscribed
by the party or his attorney; and when any pleading is verified, every subsequent pleading, except a demurrer, must be
verified also.

§ll7.—Pleadings how verllicd.

The verification must be to the effect that the same is true
to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those
matters stated on information and belief, and as to those
matters he believes it to be true; and must be by affidavit of
the party, or if there be several parties united in interest,

 

    

gwyuw C. v v-cw v v yr vgvgv y 5' ' '3

acquainted with the facts, if such party be within the county where the attorney resides, andcapable of making the
aliidavit. The ailidavit may also be made by the agent or
attorney, if the action or defence be founded upon a written
instrument for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the agent or attorney, or if all
the material allegations of the pleading be within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the pleading is verified by any other person than the party, he shall
set forth in the ailidavit his knowledge, or the grounds of
his belief on the subject, and the reasons Why it is not made
by the party. VVhen a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any officer thereof; and when the

State, or any oflicer thereof in ‘its behalf, is a party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted with the
facts. The verification may be omitted when an admission

of the truth of the allegation might subject the party to

prosecution for felony. And no pleading can be used in a
criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a fact
admitted or alleged in such pleading.

$118.-—Itens of account-—partlenlars, to be furnished when.

It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged; but he shall
deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account, which if the pleading is verified, must be verified by his own oath, or that of
his agent or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of
such agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be
true,_ or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The
court or the Judge thereof, may order a further account
when the one delivered is defective; and the court may in
all cases, order a bill of particulars of the claim of either
party to be furnished.

gl l9.—Pleadlngs how construed.

In the construction of a-pleading for the purpose of deter 

 

with a view of substantial justice between theparties.

, §l20.—In-elevant or redunda'nt——IndeIlnlte or uncertain.

If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleadin g, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person‘ aggrieved thereby. And when the allegations of a pleading are so
indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the charge
or defence is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment. ’

§12l.—-Judgments how to he pleaded.

In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court
or oilicer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or
determination .may be stated to have been duly given or
made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction. i

§122.—Conditions precedent how to he pleaded—Instrnmgnt for payment of
money only. ' ‘

In pleading the performance of ‘conditions precedent in a
contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing
such performance; but it may be stated generally’ that the
party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if
such allegation be controverted, the party_ pleading shall be
bound to establish, on the trial, the facts showing such performance. In an action or defence founded upon an instrument for the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient
for the party to give a copy of the instrument, and to state
that there is due to him thereon, from the adverse party, a
specified sum which he claims. , p ' I .

‘§l23.-—Prlvate statutes, how to he pleaded. "

In pleading a private statute or a right derived therefrom,

the day of its ratification, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof.

 

In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary
to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose
of showing the application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose: but it
shall be sufiicient to state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was so published or spoken.

§125.—Answer in such cases.

In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant
may in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter
charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances to
reduce’ the amount of damages; ‘and whether he prove the
justihcation or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating
circumstances.

(;l26.—Wlnat causes of action may in joined in the same complaint.

The plaintifl may unite in the same complaint several
causes of action, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal, or equitable, or both, where’ they all
arise out of,

1. The same transaction; or transactions connected with
the same subject of action; ‘

2. Contract express or implied; or

3. Injuries with or without force, to. person and property
or either; or

4. Injuries to character; or
5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages for the withholding thereof; and the rents and profits '

of the same; or

_ 7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by
5 operation of law. '

    

of these classes, and except in actions for the foreclosure of
mortgages, must affect all the parties to the action, and not
require diiferent places of trial, and must be separately
stated. In actions to foreclose mortgages, the court shall

have power to adjudge and direct the payment by the mortgagor of any residue of the mortgage debt that may remain
unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged premises, in cases
in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable for the
debt secured by such mortgage; and if the mortgage debt

‘ be secured by the convenant or obligation of any person

other than the mortgagor, the plaintiff may make such person a party to the action, and the court may adjudge payment of the residue of such debt remaining unsatisfied after

a sale of the mortgaged premises, against such other person,
and may enforce such' judgment as in other cases.

(;127.—-Allegatlon not denied; when to be deemed true.

Every material allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section ninety-seven, and
every material allegation of new matter in the answer, constituting a counter claim, not controverted by the reply, as
prescribed in section one hundred and one, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. But the allegation of
new matter in the answer, not relatingto a counter-claim,
or of new matter in reply, is to be deemed controverted by

the adverse party as, upon a direct denial or avoidance, as
the case may require.

CHAPTER VII.

MISTAKES IN PLEADINGS AND AMENDMENTS.

§l28.—llaterial verlanee.

N o variance between the allegation in a pleading and the
proof- shall be deemed material, unless it have actually

 

    

     
 

 
  

 
 

um. , —........;
his action upon the merits. Whenever it shall be alleged
that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to
the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been
misled; and thereupon the Judge may order the pleading to

be amended upon such terms as shall be just.

(\129.—Inmaterlal varlanee.
lWhere th8 variance is not material as provided in the last

‘ section, the Judge may direct the fact to be found according

to the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment
without costs.

§f30.—A {allure of proof, when.

Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action or
defence to which the proof is directed is unproved, not in
some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope
and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance

within the last sections, but a failure of proof.

\3l3l.—Amendments of course after allowance of demurrer.

Any pleading may be once amended by the party of
course, without costs and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at anytime before the period for answering it expires: or it can be so amended at any time within
twenty days after the service of the answer or demurrer to
such pleading, unless it be made to appear to the court that
it was done for the purpose of delay, and the plaintiff or
defendant will thereby lose the bene§t of a term for which

the cause is or may be docketed for trial; and if it appear '

to the ,court or Judge that such amendment was made for
such purpose, the same may be stricken out, and such terms
imposed as to the court or Judge may seem just. In such
case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the
adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer, the Judge
may, in his discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was
interposed in good faith, allow the party to plead over upon

such terms as may be just. It the demurrer be allowed for

united, the Judge may, in his discretion, and upon such terms
as may be just, order the action to be divided into as many
actions as may be necessary to the proper determination of
the causes of action therein mentioned.

any other respect; or by inserting other allegations material
to the case; or when the amendment does not change substaintially the claim or defence, by conforming the pleading
or proceedingto the facts. proved.

(3l33.—Rellef In case of a mistake.

The Judge may likewise in his discretion, and upon such
terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made,
or other act to be done, after the time limited by this act, or
by an order enlarge such time; and may also in his discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, at any time within

_ one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment order or other proceeding taken against him through
his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, and

any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform in any
respect to the provisions of this Code, the Judge, may in
like manner and upon like terms, permit an amendment 01
such proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto.

\')l34.—When plalntlf Ignorant of name of defendant. H

When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of a
defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleadl ing cr proceeding by name; and when his true name shall
be discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended
accordingly.

 

  
    

\ ;na:I v" .:I.r::L» an !H§J:?!‘I

The Court and the Judge thereof, shall in every stage of
action, disregard any error of defect in the pleadings or
proceedings, which shall not affect the substantial rights of

the adverse party; and no judgment shall be reversed or
affected by reason of such error or defect. '

(;186.—Supplemental pleadings.

The plaintiff and defendant respectively may be allowed
on motion to make a supplemental complaint, answer or
reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the
former complaint, answer or reply, or of which the party
was ignorant when his former pleading was made, and either
party may, by leave of the Court in any pending or future
action, set up. by a supplemental pleading, the judgment or
decree of any Court of competent jurisdiction, rendered since
the commencement of such action, determining the matter
in controversy in said action or any part thereof, and if said
judgment be set up by the plaintiff, the same shall be without prejudice to any provisional remedy theretofore issued or

more of the defendants, or of the summons according to the
provisions of section seventy-six, and that no answer has
been filed. The clerk shall thereupon enter judgment for
the amount mentioned in the summons, against the defendant or defendants, or against one or more of several defen-'
dants, in the cases provided for in section eighty-seven. But
if the complaint be not sworn to, and such action . is on an
instrument for the payment of money only, the clerk, on its
productionto him, shall assess the amount the to the plaintiff
thereon; and in other cases shall ascertain the amount which
the plaintiff is entitled to recover in such action, from his
examination, under oath, or other proof, and enter the judgment for the amount so assessedor ascertained. In case the
defendant give notice of appearance in the action, he shall
be-entitled to five days’ notice of the time and place of such
assessment. i

Where the defendant, by his answer in such action, shall
not deny the plaintiff’s claim, but shall set up a counterclaim, amounting to less than the plaintiffs claim, judgment
may be had by the plaintiff for the excess of said claim over
the said counter-claim, in like manner in any such action,
upon the plaintiffs filing with the clerk of the Court a statement admitting such counter claim, which statement shall
be annexed to and be a part of the judgment-roll.

2. In other actions the plaintiff may, upon the like proof,
apply to the Court, after the expiration of the time for
answering, for the relief demanded in the complaint. If the
taking of an account or the proof of any fact be necessary
to enable the Court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the Court may take the account or hear the
proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that

 

purpose. And where the action is for the recovery of money
only, or of specific real or personal property, with damages
for the Withholdin g thereof, the court may order the damages
to be assessed by a jury, or, if the examination of a long
account be involved, by a reference as above provided. If
the defendant give notice of appearance in the action before
the expiration of the time for answering, he shall be entitled
to eight days’ notice of the time and place of application to
the Court for the relief demanded by the complaint.

3. In actions where the service of the summons Was by
publication,‘ the plaintiff may, in like manner, apply for
judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be
made of the demand mentioned in the complaint; and it the
defendant be not a resident cf the State must require the
plaintiff or his agent to be examined on oath respecting any
payments that have been made to the plaintiff, or to any one
for his use, on account of such demand, and may render
judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover.
Before rendering judgment the court may, in its discretion,
require. the plaintiff to cause to be filed satisfactory security,
to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution’ of
any estate or effects which may be directed by such judgment
to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money
that may be collected under or by virtue of such judgment,
in case the defendant or his representatives shall apply and
be admitted to defend the action, and shall succeed in such
defence.
