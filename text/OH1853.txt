be shown in what respect he has been misled; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended,
upon such terms as may be just. .

in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found,
according to the evidence, and may order an immediate
amendment without costs.

defence, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in

amend any pleading, process or proceeding, by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, [or] a mistake in any other
respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the
case, or, when the amendment does not change substantially the claim or defence, by conforming the pleading

to the provisions of this code, the court may permit the
same to be made conformable thereto, by amendment.

case, must state, in the verification of his petition, that he.
could not discover the true name, and the summons must
contain the words, “real name unknown,” and a copy
thereof must be served personally upon the defendant.

§ 142. Either party may be allowed on notice, and on
such terms as to costs, as the court may prescribe, to file a
supplemental petition, answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former petition, answer,

CHAPTER I.

EXECUTIONS AGAINST THE PROPERTY OF THE JUDGMENT
DEBTOR.

§ 420. Lands, tenements, goods, and chattels, not exempt by law, shall be subject to the payment of debts, and
shall be liable to be taken on execution and sold as herein—
after provided. '

§ 421. The lands and tenements of the debtor within the
county where the judgment is entered, shall be bound for the
satisfactionthereof, from the first day of the term, at which
judgment is rendered ; but judgments by confession, and
judgments rendered at the same term at which the action is
commenced, shall bind such lands only from the day on
which such judgments are rendered. All other lands, as well
as goods and chattels of the debtor, shall be bound from the
time they shall be seized in execution.

§ 422. If execution shall not be sued out within five
years from the date of any judgment, that now is or may
hereafter be rendered in any court of record in this State, or
if five years shall have intervened between the date of the
last execution issued on such judgment and the time of suing
out another writ of execution thereon, such judgment shall
become dormant, and shall cease to operate as a lien on the
estate of the judgment debtor.

§ 423. The writ of execution against the property of the
judgment debtor, issuing from any court of record in this
State, shall command the officer to whom it is directed, that
of the goods and chattels of the debtor, he cause to be made
the money specified in the writ; and for want of goods and
chattels, be cause the same to be made of the lands and tenements of the debtor; and the exact amount of the debt,
damages and costs, for which the judgment is entered, shall
be endorsed on the execution.

§ 424. When two or more writs of execution against the
same debtor, shall be sued out during the term in which judgment was rendered, or within ten days thereafter. and when
two or more writs of execution against the same debtor, shall
be delivered to the officer on_ the same day, no preference
shall be given to either of such writs ; but if a sufficient sum
of money be not made. to satisfyall, executions, the amount

made shall be distributed to the several creditors in proportion to the amount of their respective demands. In all other
cases, the writ of execution first delivered to the officer shall
be first satisfied. And it shall be the duty of the oflicer to indorse on every writ of execution, the time when he received
the same ; but nothing herein contained, shall be so construed
as to affect any referable lien, which one or more of the
judgments, on w ich execution issued, may have on the lands
of the judgment debtor.
§ 425. The oflicer to whom a writ of execution is delivered, shall proceed, immediately, to levy the same upon the
goods and chattels of the debtor ; but if no goods and chattels can be found, the officer shall endorse on the writ of
execution “ no goods,” and forthwith levythe writ of execution upon the lands and tenements of the debtor, which may
be liable to satisfy the judgment.
§ 4‘26. If the officer, by virtue of any writ of execution,
issued from any court of record in this State, shall levy the
same on any goods and chattels claimed by any person
other than the defendant, it shall be the duty of said officer,
forthwith, to give notice in writing, to some justice of the
peace of the county, in which shall be set forth the names
of the plaintiff and defendant, together with the name of
the claimant; and at the same time he shall furnish the said
justice of the peace with a schedule of the property claimed.
And it shall be the duty of such justice of the peace, immediately upon the receipt of such notice and schedule, to make
an entry of the same upon his docket, and issue a writ of
summons, directed to the sheriff, or any constable of the
county, commanding him to summon five disinterested men,
having the qualifications of electors, who shall be named in
said summons, to appear before him the said justice, at the
time and place therein mentioned, which time shall not be
more than three days after the date of said writ, ‘to try and
determine the right of the claimant to the property in controversy. And it shall be the duty of the claimant to give
two days notice in writing, to the plaintiff or other party,
for whose benefit such execution was issued and levied as
aforesaid, his agent or attorney, if within the county, of the
time and place of such trial; and he shall, moreover, prove
to the satisfaction of said justice that such notice was given,
or that the same could not be given by reason of the absence
of the par , his agent, or attorney.
§ 427. he jury summoned as aforesaid, shall be sworn
to try and determine the right of the claimant to the property
in controversy, and a true verdict to give, .aceording to evidence. If the jury shall find the right to said goods and
chattels, or any part thereof, to be in the claimant, they shall
also find the value thereof, and “the justice shall render judgment upon such finding of: the jury, for the claimant, that he

recover his costs against the plaintiff in execution, or other
party to the same, for whose benefit the execution issued,
and also that he have restitution of said goods and chattels,
or any part thereof, according to the finding of the jury. But
if the right of the said goods and chattels, and every art
thereof, shall not be in the claimant, according to the m1ing of said jury, then the said justice shall render judgment
on such finding, in favor of the plaintiff in execution, or
other party for whose benefit the same was issued _' and
levied, against said claimant for costs, and award execution thereon. Said justice of the peace, in the taxation of
costs accruing by reason of such claim and trial, shall allow
each juror summoned and sworn, the sum of fifty cents;
and for the sheriff, constable, or other officer, and witnesses, and for himself, he shall tax such fees, as are allowed
by law, to each, respectively, for like services rendered in
other cases. such judgment for the claimant, (unless an
undertaking shall be executed, as provided in the next section,) shall be a justification of the officer in returning “ no
goods” to the writ of execution, by virtue of which the
levy has been made, as to such part of the goods and chat~
tels, as were found to belong to such claimant.

§ 428. If the jury shall find the property or any part
thereof to be in the claimant, and the plaintiff in execution,
shall, at any time within three days after such trial, tender
to the sheriff or other officer having such property in his custody on execution, an undertaking with good and sufficient
sureties,payable to such claimant, in double the amount of'
the value of such property as assessed by the jury, to the
effect that they will pay all damages sustained by reason of
the detention or sale of such property, then the sheriff or
other officer shall deliver said undertaking to claimant, and
proceed to sell such property, as if no such trial of the right
of propert had taken place, and shall not be liable to the
claimant t erefor.

§ 429. In all cases where a sheriff, coroner, or other
officer, shall by virtue of an execution, levy upon any goods
and chattels which shall remain upon his hands unsold, for
want of bidders, for the want of time to advertise and sell,
or any other reasonable cause, the officer may, for his own
security, take of the defendant an undertaking, with security,
in such sum as he may deem sufficient, to the effect that the
said pro erty shall be delivered to the officer holding an execution En the sale of the same, at the time and place appointed by said ofiicer, either by notice given in writing to
said defendant in execution, or by advertisement, published
in a newspaper printed in the county, naming therein the
day and place of sale. If the defendant shall fail to deliver
the goods and chattels at the time and'place mentioned in
the notice to him given, or to pay to the officer holding the

execution the full value of said goods and chattels, or the
amount of said debt and costs, the undertaking, given as
aforesaid, shall be considered as broken, and may be proceeded on as in other cases.

§ 430. The officer who levies upon goods and chattels,
by virtue of an execution issued by a court of record, before
he proceeds to sell the same, shall cause public notice to be
given of the time and place of sale, for at least ten days
before the day of sale. The notice shall be given by advertisement, published in some newspaper printed in the county, or in case no newspaper be printed therein,by setting up
advertisements in five public places in the county ; two
advertisements shall be ut up in the township where the
sale is to be held. An where goods and chattels levied
upon, cannot be sold for want of bidders, the ofiicer
making such return, shall annex to the execution a true and
perfect inventory of such goods and chattels; and the plaintiff in such execution may thereupon sue out another writ of
execution directing the sale of the property levied upon as
aforesaid; but such goods and chattels shall not be sold, unless the time and place of sale be advertised, as hereinbefore provided. .

§ 431. When any writ shall issue, directing the sale of
property previously taken in execution, the ofiicer issuing
sai writ, shall, at the request of the person entitled to the
benefit thereof, his agent or attorney, add thereto a command
to the ofIicerto whom such writ shall be directed, that, if the

roperty remaining in his hands not sold shall, in his opinion,

be insufficient to satisfy the judgment, he shall levy the same
upon the lands and tenements, goods and chattels, or either,
as the law shall permit, being the property of the judgment
debtor, suflicient to satisfy the debt. '

§ 432. If execution be levied upon lands and tenements,
the oflicer levying such execution shall call an inquest of
three disinterested freeholders, who shall be resident within
the county where the lands taken in execution are situate,
and administer to them an oath, impartially to appraise the
property so levied u on, upon actual view; and such free01 ers shall forthwit return to the said oiiicer, under their

hands, an estimate of the real value in money, of said property. .
§ 433. The officer receiving such return, shall forthwith
deposite a copy thereof with the clerk of the court from
which the writ issued, and immediately advertise and sell
such real estate, agreeably to the provisions of this title.

§ 434. If, upon such return as aforesaid, it appear by the
inquisition, that two-thirds of the appraised value of said
lands and tenements so levied upon is suflicient to satisfy
the execution, with costs, the judgment on which such execution issued, shall not operate, as a lien, on the residue of the
debtor’s estate, to the prejudice of any other judgment creditor. But no tract of land shall be sold for less than two—
thirds of the value returned in the inquest; and nothing in
this section contained, shall in any wise extend to affect
the sale of lands by the State, but all lands therein, the property of individuals, indebted to the State for any debt or
taxes, or in any other manner, except for loans heretofore
authorized by the legislature, shall be sold without valuation, for the discharge of such debt, or taxes, agreeably to
the laws for such case made and provided.

§ 435. If the property of any clerk, sheriff, coroner, justice of the peace, constable, or any collector of State, county,
town, or township tax, shall be levied on, for, or on account
of any moneys that now are, or may hereafter be by them
collected, or received in their oflicial capacity, the property
so levied on, shall be sold without valuation.

§ 436. Lands and tenements, taken in execution, shall
not be sold, until the oflicer cause public notice of the time
and place of sale to be given, for at least thirty days before
the day of sale, by advertisement in some newspaper, printed
in the county; or, in case no newspaper be printed in the
county, in some newspaper in general circulation therein,
and by putting up an advertisement upon the court house
door, and in five other public places in the county, two of
which shall be in the township where such lands and tenements lie. All sales made without such advertisement, shall
be set aside, on motion, by the court to which the execution
is returnable.

§ 437. Ifthe court, upon the return of any writ of execution, for the satisfaction of which any lands and tenements
have been sold, shall, after having carefully examined the proceedings of the officer, be satisfied that the sale has, in all
respects, been made in conformity to the provisions of this
title, the court shall direct the clerk to make an entry on the
journal, that the court is satisfied of the legality of such sale,
and an order that the oflicer make to the purchaser, a deed
for such lands and tenements; and the oflicer, on making
such sale, may retain the purchase money in his hands, until
the court shall have examined his proceedings, as aforesaid,
when he shall pay the same to the person entitled thereto,
agreeably to the order of the court. '

§ 438. The sheriff, or other ,oflicer, who, upon such writ,
or writs of execution, shall sell the said lands and tenements,
or any part thereof, shall make to the purchaser or purchasers thereof, as good and ~ sufficient a deed of conveyance of
the lands and tenements sold, as the person, or persons
against whom such writ, or writs of execution were issued,
could have. made of the_same, at,',or any time after they became liable to the judgment. The deed shall be suflicient

evidence of the legality of such sale, and the proceedings
therein, until the contrary be proved, and shall vest in
the purchaser as good and as perfect an estate in the
premises therein mentioned, as was vested in the party at, or
after the time, when such lands and tenements became
liable to the satisfaction of the judgment. And such deed
of conveyance, to be made by the sheriff, or other officer
shall recite the execution, or *executions, or the substance
thereof, and the names of the parties, the amount, and date
of term of rendition of each judgment, by virtue whereof
the said lands and tenements were sold as aforesaid; and
shall be executed, acknowledged and recorded as is, or may
be provided by law, to perfect the conveyance of real estate
in other cases.

§ 439. The officer who levies u on goods and chattels,
or lands and tenements, or who is charged with the duty of
selling the same by virtue of any writ of execution, may
refuse to publish a notice of the sale thereof by advertisement in a newspaper, until the party for whose benefit such
execution issued, his agent, or attorney, shall advance to
such officer, so much money as will be sufficient to discharge
the fees of the printer, for publishing such notice.

§ 440. Before any officer shall be excused from giving
the notification mentioned in the last section, he shall demand
of the party for whose benefit the execution was issued, his
agent, or attorney, (provided either of them reside in the
county,) the fees in said section specified.

§ 441. All sales of lands or tenements under execution,
shall be held at the court house, in the county in which such
lands and tenements are situated. No sheriff, or other officer, making the sale of property, either personal, or real, nor
any appraiser of such property, shall either, directly or
indirectly, purchase the same ; and every purchase so made,
shall be considered fraudulent and void. § 442. If lands and tenements levied on as aforesaid, are
not sold upon one execution, other executions may be issued,
to sell the lands so levied upon.

§ 443. In all cases, where two or more executions shall
be put into the hands of any sheriff, or other officer, and it
shall be necessary to levy on real estate to satisfy the same,
and either of the judgment creditors in whose favor one or
more of said executions is issued, shall require the sheriff, or
other officer, to make a separate levy to satisfy his execution, or executions, it shall be the duty of the sheriff, or other
officer, to levy said executions, or so many thereof as may
be required, on separate parcels of the real property of the
judgment debtor, or debtors ; giving to the officer making the
levy on behalf of the creditor, whose execution may, by the
provisions of this chapter, be entitled to a reference, the
choice of such part offthe. real. property of? the judgment

debtor, or debtors, as will be sufficient, at two-thirds of the
appraised value, to satisfy the same. And in all cases where
two or more executions, which are entitled to no preference
over each other, are put into the hands of the same officer, it
shall be the duty of the officer, when required, to levy the
same on separate parcels of the real property of the judgment debtor, or debtors, when, in the opinion of the appraisers, the same may be divided without material injury : and
if the real property of said debtors will not be sufficient, at
two-thirds of its appraised value, to satisfy all the executions
chargeable thereon, such part of the same shall be levied on
to satisfy each execution, as will bear the same proportion in
value to the whole, as the amount due on the execution,
bears to the amount of all the executions chargeable thereon, as near as may be, according to the appraised value of
each separate parcel of said real property.
' § 444. If the term of service of the sheriff, or other officer, who has made, or shall hereafter make sale of any lands
and tenements, shall expire ; or if the sheriff, or other officer
shall be absent, or be rendered unable by death, or otherwise, to make a deed of conveyance of the same, any succeeding sheriff, or other officer, on receiving a certificate
from the court from which execution issued for the sale of
said lands and tenements, signed by the clerk, by order of
said court, setting forth that sufficient proof has been made
to the court, that such sale was fairly and legally made ; and,
on tender of the purchase money, or if the same, or any part
thereof be paid, then, on proof of such payment and tender
of the balance, if any, may execute to the said purchaser, or
purchasers, or his or their legal representatives, a deed of
conveyance of the said lands and tenements so sold. Such
deed shall be as good and valid in law, and have the same
effect, as if the sheriff, or other officer, who made the sale,

had executed the same.

§ 445. If on any sale made as aforesaid, there shall be in
the hands of the sheriff or other officer, more money than is
sufficient to satisfy the writ or writs of execution, with interests and costs, the sheriff or other officer shall, on demand,
pay the balance to the defendant in execution or his legal representatives.

§ 446. If any judgment or judgments, in satisfaction of
which any lands or tenements, are sold, shall at any time
thereafter be reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or affect
the title of the purchaser or purchasers ; but in such case,
restitution shall be made by the judgment creditor of the
moneys, for which such lands or tenements were sold, with
lawful interest from the day of sale.

{3 447. No judgment, heretofore rendered or which hereafter may be rendered, on which execution shall not have
been taken out and levied, before the expiration of one year
next after its rendition, shall operate as a lien on the estate

of any debtor, to the prejudice of any other bona fide judgment
creditor. But in all cases, where [judgment] has been or maybe
rendered in the district or supreme court, and a special mandate awarded to the court of common pleas, to carry the same
into execution, the lien of the judgment creditor shall continue
for one year after the first day of the term of the court of common pleas, to which such mandate may be directed. Nothing
in this subject contained, shall be construed to defeat the
lien of any judgment creditor, who shall fail to take out execution and cause a levy to be made as herein provided,
when such failure shall be occasioned by a peal, proceedings in error, injunction, or by a vacancy in t e office of sheriff and coroner, or the inability of such officer, until one
year after such disability shall be removed. In all cases,
where real estate has been or may hereafter be taken on execution and a praised, and twice advertised and offered for
sale, and shal remain unsold for want of bidders, it shall be
the duty of the court from which such execution issued, on
motion of the plaintiff, to set aside such appraisement, and
order a new one to be made, or to set aside such levy and
appraisement, and award a new execution to issue, as the
case may require.

§ 448. The sheriff or other officer, to whom any writ of
execution shall be directed, shall return such writ to the
court to which the same is returnable, within sixty days
from the date thereof.

§ 449. In all cases where judgment is rendered in any
court of record within this State, upon any other instrument
of writing, in which two or more persons are jointly and
severally bound, and it shall be made to appear to the
court, by parol or other testimony, that one or more of said
persons so bound, signed the same as surety or bail for his
or their co-defendant, it shall be the duty of the clerk of
said court, in recording the judgment thereon, to certify
which of the defendants is principal debtor, and which are
sureties or bail. And the clerk of the court aforesaid, shall
issue execution on such judgment, commanding the sheriff
or other oflicer, to cause the money to be made of the goods
and chattels, lands and tenements, of the principal debtor,
but for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor, to
make the same, that he cause the same to be made of the
goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the surety or
bail. In all cases, the property, both personal and real, of the
principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the court, shall be
exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail
shall be taken in execution.

§ 450. Each freeholder, summoned to a praise real
estate under the provisions 9f this cha ter, sha 1 be allowed
and receive for his servicesfthe sum 0 fifty cents, for each
day he may be so engaged as such appraiser, to be collected

on the execution, by virtue of which the property appraised
was levied on, if claimed at the time of making the return of
such appraisement. And when any freeholder, summoned
as aforesaid, shall fail to appear at the time and place appointed by the officer, and discharge his duty as appraiser,
e shall, on complaint being made to any justice of the
peace of the township in which such freeholder resides, forfeit and pay the sum of fifty cents, for eve such neglect,
unless he can render a reasonable excuse. uch sum shall
be collected by said justice, and paid into the township treasury, for the use of the township. ‘
§ 451. If any sheriff or other officer shall refuse or neglect to execute any writ of executibn to him directed, which
has come to his hands ; or shall neglect or refuse to sell any
goods and chattels, lands and tenements; or shall neglect
to call an inquest, and return a copy thereof forthwith to the
clerk’s office, or shall neglect to return any writ of execution
to the proper court, on or before the return day thereof, or
shall neglect to return a just and erfect inventory of all and
singular the goods and chattels y him taken in execution,
unless the said sheriff or other ofiicer shall return, that he has
levied and made the amount of the debt, damages and costs ;
or shall refuse or neglect, on demand, to pay over to the
plaintiff, his agent or attorney of record, all moneys by him
collected or received, for the use of said party, at any time
after collecting or receiving the same, except as provided in section four hundred and thirty-seven; or shall
neglect or refuse, on demand made by the defendant, his
agent, or attorney of record, to pay over all moneys by him
received for any sale made, beyond What is sufficient to satisfy the writ or writs of execution, with interest and legal
costs; such sheriff or other officer shall, on motion in court
and two days notice thereof in writing, be amerced in the
amount of said debt, damages and costs, with ten per cent.
thereon, to and for the use of said plaintiff or defendant, as
the case may be.
§ 452. If any clerk of a court, shall neglect or refuse, on
demand made by the person entitled thereto, his agent, or
attorney of record, to pay over all money by him received, in
his official capacity, for the use of such person, every such
clerk may be amerced ; and the proceedings against him and
his sureties shall be the same as provided for in the foregoing

section against sheriffs and their sureties.
§ 453. When the cause of amercement is for refusing to

pay over money collected as aforesaid, the said sheriff or
other ofiicer shall not be amerced in a greater sum than the
amount so withheld, with ten per cent. thereon.

§ 454. When execution shall be issued in any county in this
State, and directed to the sheriff or coroner of another county,
it shall be lawful for such sheriff or coroner having the execution, after having discharged all the duties required of him
by law, to enclose such execution, by mail, to the clerk of the
court who issued the same. On proof being made by such
sheriff or coroner that the execution was mailed soon enough
to have reached the office where it was issued, within the
time prescribed by law, the sheriff or coroner shall not be liable for any amercement or penalty, if it do not reach the
office in due time. "

§ 455. No sheriff shall forward by mail any money, made
on any such execution, unless he shall be specially instructed
to do it, by the plaintiff, his agent or attorney of record. In
all cases of a motion to amerce a sheriff or other officer of
any county from which the execution issued, notice in writing
shall be given to such oflicer, as herein before required, by
leaving it with him, or- at his office, at least fifteen days before
the first day of the term at which such motion shall be made,
or by transmitting the notice by mail, at least sixty days
prior to the first day of the term at which such motion shall

e made. All amercements, so procured, shall be entered on

the record of the court, and shall have the same force and
effect as a judgment.

officer, may be made party to the judgment rendered as
aforesaid, against the sheriff or other officer, by action,
to be commenced and prosecutedas in other cases. But the
goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of any such surety
shall not be liable to be taken on execution, when suflicient
goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the sheriff or
other officer against whom execution may be issued, can be
found to satisfy the same. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent either party from proceeding against such sheriff or

hundred and twenty-six, and that the defendant unlawfully
keeps him out of the possession. It shall not be necessary
to state how the plaintiff ’s estate or ownership is derived.

“§ 559. It shall be sufficient, in such action, if the defendant in his answer, deny, generally, the title alleged in the petition, or that he withholds the possession, as the case may
be; but if he deny the title of the plaintiff, ossession by the
defendant shall be taken as admitted. W ere he does not
defend for the whole premises, the answer shall describe the
particular part for which defence is made.

§ 560. In an action by a tenant in common of real property, against a co-tenant, the plaintiff must state, in addition
to what is required in section five hundred and fifty-eight,
that the defendant either denied the plaintiff ’s right or did
some act amounting to such denial.

§ 561. In an action for the recovery of real property,

recover for withholding the roperty. .

§ 562. In an action for t e recovery of real preperty, the
party against whom judgment is rendered, may, at any time

actions for such partition brought under this act, so far as
the same can be so applied ti) the substance and subject matter of the action, without regard to its form.

CHAPTER IV.

PROCEEDINGS UPON MANDAMUS.

§ 569. The writ of mandamus may be issued to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the
performance of an act, which the law specially enjoins as a
duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. But though
it may require an inferior tribunal to exercise its judgment,
or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions, it cannot
control judicial discretion.

§570. This writ may not be issued in any case, where
there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of the law. It may issue on the information of the party
beneficially interested.

§ 571. The writ is either alternative or peremptory. The
alternative writ must state concisely the facts showing the
obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission to perform it, and command him, that immediately upon
the receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, he do
the act required to be performed, or show cause before the
court whence the writ issued, at a specified time and place,
why he has not done so; and that he, then and there, return
the writ,-with his certificate of having done as he is commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a similar form,
exce t that the words requiring the defendant to show cause
why he has not done as commanded, must be omitted.

§ 572. When the right to require the performance of the
act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be
given for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus may
be allowed in the first instance. In all other cases, the
alternative writ must be first issued. '

§ 573. The motion for the writ must be made upon affidavit, and the court may require a notice of the application to
be given to the adverse party, or may grant an order to
show cause why it should not be allowed, or may grant the
writ without notice.

§ 574. The allowance of the writ must be endorsed thereon, signed by a judge of the court granting it, and the writ
must be served personally upon the defendant. If the defendant duly served neglect to return the same, he shall be
proceeded against, as for a contempt. ,

§575. On the return-day of the alternative writ, or such
further day, as the court may allow, the party on whom the
writ shall have been served, may show cause, by answer
made, in the same manner as an answer to a petition, in a
civil action. .

§ 576. If no answer be made, a eremptory mandamus
must be allowed against the defen ant. If an answer be
made, containing new matter, the same shall not in any respect, conclude the plaintiff, who may on the trial or other
proceeding, avail himself of any valid ob'ection to its sufficiency, or may countervail it by proof, eit er in direct denial
or by way of avoidance.

§ 577. No other pleading or written allegation'is allowed,
than the writ and answer. These are the pleadings in the
case, and have the same effect and are to be construed and
may be amended in the same manner, as pleadings in a civil
action; and the issues thereby joined, must be tried and the
further proceedings thereon had in the same manner, as in
a civil action.

§ 578. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he shall
recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to be
ascertained by the court or a jury or by referees, in a civil
action, and costs; and a eremptory mandamus shall, also,
be granted to him withou delay.

§ 579. A recovery of damages by virtue of this chapter,
against a party, who shall have made a return to a writ of
mandamus, is a bar to any other action against the same
party for the making of such return.

§ 580. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is directed to
any public oflicer, body or board, commanding the performance of any public duty, pecially enjoined by law, if it appear to the court, that such officer, or any member of such
body, or board, has, without just excuse, refused or neglected
to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a fine
not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon every such ofiicer
or member of such body or board. Such fine, when collected,
shall be paid into the treasury of the county, where the duty
ought to have been performed; and the payment thereof, is a
bar to an action for any penalty incurred by such officer, or
member of such body or board, by reason of his refusal or
neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.
