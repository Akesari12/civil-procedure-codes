‘In Senate, January 29, 1848.

Resolved, (If the Assembly concur,) that the mnstitution of
the United States has vested in Congress the entire and exclusive legislative power over “ commerce with foreign nations
and among the several states,” and as there cannot exist
an extensive commercial intercourse with foreign nations, and
among the several states without safe and convenient bar~
bors, it is the right and duty of Congress and of the Excutive
to make judicious ap ropriations for the improvement of the
harbors on the lake rontier and on the Atlantic and PaciEc
sea costs. r

CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS. '

Resolved, That the constitution has entrusted to the general government, not only the regulation of commerce with
foreign nations and among the several states, .but also the
common defence and general welfare of the nation. That
a faithful execution of these trusts further requires the
making of such improvements to the obstructed navigation of
important rivers within our country, as will facilitate the conveyance of munitions of war, foster the union of the States,
ai their mutual intercourse and ensure a cheap and speedy
transit of their productions to profitable markets and in our
right as a state, that in a spirit of compromise yielded up
vast revenues to secure practically the reciprocal benefits promised from the Federal Union, we call upon the general

V government to fulfil the duties thus confided to it.

Resolved, That by means of imposts on our imports and
canal tolls on our products, our trade is too much burthened
to bear a further duty on tonnage as proposed in the President’s message; that such duty would lessen the revenue
from our canals and divert the products of the west to rival
channels and injuriously affect the interests of our people
and the prosperity of the state.

Resolved, That we disapprove of the late veto message of
the President on the Harbor’ bill.
