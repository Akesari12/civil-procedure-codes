oflice.

§ 437. A sheriff or jailer, upon whom a paper in a

dy, is served, must forthwith deliver it to the prisoner,

damages occasioned thereby; and by a wilful omission

in this respect, is guilty of a. misdemeanor.

jail or any other prison in the county, or to arrest or
detain a prisoner, or to enforce the process,\ order or

tempt, or for trial or upon conviction for a public offence,

or in default of security to appear as a witness in a
criminal action, must ‘be actually confined in the

jail, until he is legally discharged; and if he be per-
mitted to go at large out of the jail, except by vir-
tue of a legal order or process, it is an escape, and

the sherill" or jailer permitting it is punishable for a mis-

demeanor; and when the prisoner escaping is also held
until he pay a sum of money to a private party, that

party may recover, in a civil action against the sheriff,

his damages sustained by reason of the escape.

§ 456. A sheriff who suffers the escape of a prisoner,
arrested or in jail, without the consent or connivance of
the party in whose behalf the arrest or imprisonment
was made, is liable to an action by such party therefor

as follows:

1. When the arrest is upon an order of arrest in a
civil action, when the presence of the defendant at the
return of the summons is necessary to enable the plain-

tiff to proceed in the action, and the defendant does not

appear at the time and place specified for the return of
the summons:

2. When the arrest or imprisonment is upon an or-
der of arrest in any other civil action, or upon a surren-

der in exoneration of the sheriff or of bail, and the
defendant is not found upon an execution against his
person, issued to the proper county on a judgment in

such nction:

to enforce the payment of money, and the party arrested
is not recaptured or surrendered into custody, at the ex-

piration of the time limited for the service thereof, or

sureties, a judgment against the sheriff is conclusive

his sureties, as to any matter which was or might have
been controverted in the action against the sherilf. In

an action by the sheriff against the prisoner or his sure-
ties, the judgment against the sheriff for the escape of

the prisoner, is evidence of the damages sustained by

him, in the same manner as if it had been collected ;
and heis also entitled to recover his costs and reason-
able expenses in defending the action against him, as

part of his damages.

§461. If the action be brought against the sheriff,
when security for the jail liberties has been taken, the

from them the amount of the judgment be. may recover,

his o$ce. If a sheriff be convicted, as provided in this

section, the court must immediately report the fact of
his conviction to the governor.

whom the service is to be made, or that he is a ne-

cessary or proper party to an action, relating to real
property in this state, such court or judge may grant
an order that the service be made, by the publication

of a summons, in either of the following cases:
I. Where the defendant is a foreign corporation:

_ 2. Where the defendant being a resident of this state,
has departed therefrom with intent to defraud his. cre-

ditors, or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps
himself concealed therein, with the like intent.

at his place of residence, unless it appear that such
residence is neither known to the party making the ap-

plication, nor can with reasonable diligence be ascer-

tained by him. When publication is ordered, personal

service of a copy of the summons and complaint, out

of the state, is equivalent to publication, and depo-
site in the post office. In either case the service of the

§ 820. If a party die after a verdict or decision upon
an issue of fact, and before judgment, the court may
nevertheless render judgment thereon. Such judgment

is not a lien on the real property of the deceased party,
but is payable in the course of administration on his

1 § 821. Immediately after entering the judgment, the
clerk must attach together and tile the following papers,
which constitute the judgment roll:

1. In case the complaint be not answered by any

copies thereof, and a copy of the judgment with any.
verdict or report, the offer of the defendant, exceptions,

and all orders relating to a change of parties, or in

any way involving the merits and necessarily affect-
ing the judgment. If a statement of the case be made,
the same may be attached to the judgment roll, on the

request of either party, and thenceforth forms a part
thereof.

When the defendant is entitled to judgment, if the
plaintiff shall not have filed the summons, with proof

of service and the pleadings on his part, the copies ‘of
summons and pleadings served on the defendant, may

be substituted therefor in making the judgment roll, or

the plaintiff may, at the instance of the defendant, be
ordered by a judge forthwith to file such papers.

Upon an exemplification of a judgment, as evidence

only that part of the roll which consists of the summons,
pleadings, and judgment need be given.

thereupon the judgment becomes a lien on real proper-
ty in the county, from the time of docketing it therein.

Amended Code, § 282.

§823. The lien, mentioned in the last section, err-
tends to all the real property of the judgment debtor in

thezcounty, owned by him at the ti me of the judgment,
or afterwards acquired, and continues till the first day
of ‘July, 1860, on all unsatisfied judgments rendered
or which may be rendered before that time. But after

the first ‘day of January, 1860, there can be no such
lien.

1. The names of the parties to the judgment:
2. The amount of the judgment: and

3. The precise time of his entry.

See 2 R. -S. 359 §6, &. 36l,§ 13.

§ 825. Satisfaction of a judgment may be entered in
the clerk’s register and docket, upon an execution re-

turned satisfied, or upon an acknowledgment of satis-
faction filed with the clerk, made in the manner of an

acknoxvledgmentof a conveyance of real property, by
the judgment creditor, or within two years after the

judgment, by the attorney, unless a revocation of his
authority is previously entered upon the register. When-
ever a judgment is satisfied in fact, otherwise than upon

an execution, it is the duty of the party or attorney to

give such acknowledgment, and upon motion, the court

may compel it, or may order the entry of satisfaction to
be made without it. And whenever a judgment is sat-
istied in fact as to any one of several defendants, an
entry to that effect may be made in the register and

docket.

§ 91.2. If} upon the trial of such action, it appear, that
the trespass was casual or involuntary, or that the de-
fendant had probable cause to believe, that the land, on

which the trespass was committed, was his own, or
that of the person in whose service, or by whose direc-
tion, the act was done, judgment must be given for

only the single damages assessed in the action.

§ 913. Nothing in the last two sections authorises the
recovery of more than the just value of the timber, ta-

ken from uncultivated wood land, for the repair of a
public highway or bridge upon the land or adjoining it.

§ 914. If a person be put out of real property
in a forcible manner, without lawful authority,

if a person claiming in good faith, under color of title,
to be rightfully in possession, so put out or kept out,
recover damages therefor, judgment may be entered in

tual damages are assessed.

of inheritance, or for life or years, an action may be

brought by one or more of such persons, for a partition

thereof‘, according to the respective rights of the persons
interested therein, and for a sale of such property, or a

part of it, if it appear that a partition cannot be made,
without great prejudice to the owners.

§ 921. The summons must be addressed by name to
all the joint tenants, and tenants in common, who are
known, and generally to all persons unknown, having
or claiming an interest in the property.

§ 922. The interests of all persons in the property,
whether such persons be known or unknown, must be
set forth in the complaint specifically and particularly,
as far as known to the plaintiff, and if any one or more
of the parties, or the share or quantity of interest of any

of the parties, be unknown to the plaintiff, or be uncer-
tain or contingent, or the ownership of the inheritance
depend upon executory devise, or the remainder be a
contingent remainder, so that such parties can not be
named, that fact must be set forth in the complaint.

V § 923. The plaintiff may at his option, make credit-
ors, having a specific or general lien upon the property
or upon any particular portion thereof, parties to the ac-

tion.

§ 924. When the lien is on an undivided interest or
estate of any of the parties, such lien, if a partition 
made, is thenceforth a charge only on the share assign-
ed to such party; but such share must be first charged

with its just proportion of the costs of the partition, in
preference to such lien.

§ 925. If a party having a share or interest  un-
known, or either of the known parties reside out of the

state or cannot be found therein, and such fact be made
to appear by affidavit, the summons may be served on
such absent or unknown party, by publication, directed
by the court or judge, in the manner prescribed by sec-

tions 629 and 630. When publication is made, the
summons, as published, must be accompanied by a

brief description of the property, which is the subject
of the action.

§ 926. The rights of the several parties, plaintiffs, as
well as defendants, may be put in issue, -tried and de-
termined by such action; and where a defendant fails

to answer, or where a sale of the premises is necessary,
the title must be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction

of the court, before the judgment for partition or sale
is given.

§ 927. If it be alleged in the complaint, and estab-
lished by evidence, to the satisfaction of the court, that
the property or any part of it is so situated, that parti-
tion cannot be made, without great prejudice to the
owners, the court may order a sale thereof, and for that
purpose may appoint one or more referees. Otherwise,
upon the requisite proofs being made, it must order a
partition, according to the respective rights of the par-

ties, as ascertained by the court", and appoint three
referees therefor; and must designate the portion to
remain undivided, for. the owners, whose interests

remain unknown or not ascertained.

§‘928. In making the partition, referees must divide
the property, and allot the several portions thereof to

the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively
considered, according to the respective rights of the
parties, as determined by the court, designating the

several portions by proper landmarks, and may employ
an surveyor, with the necessary assistants, to aid them

therein.

§ 929. The referees must make report of their pro-
ceedings, specifying therein the manner of executing

their trust, describing the property divided, and the
shares allotted to each party, with a particular descrip-

tion of each share.

§ 930. ‘The court may confirm or set aside the report,‘

and if necessary, appoint new referees. Upon the re-*

port being confirmed, judgment must be rendered, that

such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is
binding and conclusive:

1. On all the parties named therein, and their legal-

representatives, who have at the time any interest in
the property divided, as owners in fee, or as tenants for

years, or as entitled to the reversion, remainder or in-
heritance of such property, after the termination of a

particular estate therein: or who, by any contingency,
may be ‘entitled to .a- beneficial interest in the property,
or who have an interest in-an individual share thereof;
as tenants for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower:

2. On all persons interested in the property, who may
be unknown, to whom notice shall have been given of
the application for partition by the publication directed,
by section 925-: and,

- :3. On _all-other persons claiming from such parties or:
persons, or either of them.

§ 931. But such judgment and partition cannot affect
tenants, or persons having claims as tenants, in dower,
by the curtesy or for life, to the whole of the property,
which is the subject of the partition ; nor can ‘such
judgment and partition preclude any person, except
such as are specified in the’ last section, from.claimi.ng,
title to the property in question, or from controverting,
the title of the parties between whom the partition is

made. '

§ 932. The expenses of the referees, including those
of a surveyor and his assistants, when employed. must
be ascertained and allowed by the court; and the
amount thereof} together with the fees allowed by law

to the referees, must be paid by the plaintiff, and may

be allowed aspart of the charges.

§933. If the referees report’ to the court, that the
property, of which partition shall have been directed,

or any distinct portion thereof, is so situated, that a
partition thereof cannot be made, without great preju-
dice to the owners; and the court is satisfied that such
report is correct, it may thereupon, by an order, direct
the referees to sell the property, or portion so situated.

§ 934. When a part of the property only is ordered
to be sold, if there be an estate by the curtesy, in dow-
er, or for life or years, in an undivided share of the
property, the whole of such estate may be set off in
any part of the property not ordered to be sold.

§ 935. Before the making of an order for sale, where
the creditors having specific liens have not been made
parties, the court, on the motion of either party, must
direct the plaintiff to amend his complaint, if necessa-
ry, by making every person having a specific lien on
the undivided interest or estate of any of the parties by

m’ortgage, devise or otherwise, a party to the action.

'§ 936. The plaintiff must produce to the court the
certificate of the clerk of the county where the proper-

ty issituated, showing whether there are any general

liens by judgment upon the property, or any part there-
of. '

§ 937. Unless it be made to appear to the court by

the certificate of the clerk pursuant to the last section,
that there are outstanding no general liens on the pro-

perty, or on any share or parcel thereof‘, the court must
order a reference to ascertain them.

§ 938. If it appear by the certificate that there are out-

standing of record such general liens, the court must
appoint a referee to ascertain whether such liens have

been paid, or if not paid, what amount remains due or

secured by them respectively, and the order of priority
in which they are entitled to be paid out of the pro-

perty.

§ 939. The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served,
at least ten days before the time for appearance, on
each person having such general lien, to appear before
the referee at a specified time and place, to make proof
by his own adidavit or otherwise, of the true amount

due, or to become due, contingently or absolutely, bu
his judgment." A ‘

§940. The referee must receive the evidence, and
report, the names of the creditors whose liens are es-
tablished, the amounts thereof, and their priority re-

spectively, and if such liens are contingent he must
specify them. He must attach to his report the proof

of service of the notices, and the affidavits and copies
of other evidence before him.

§ 941. Any creditor having a lien, and being dissatis-
tied with the report of the referee, may move the court

to correct it, at any time.before distribution of the pro-
eeeds of sale, on ten days’ notice to the plainti&' and

the other persons in whose favor liens arereported, and

thereupon the court may correct the report on the evi-
dence reported, or if necessary, may order a new refer-

ence of the whole or of any part of the matter. When
confirmed, the report is conclusive of the rights of the

several creditors on whom notice was served.

§942. The proceeds of the sale of the incumbered

property, must be applied under the direction of the

court, as follows:

1. To pay its just proportionof the general costs of
the action:

2. To pay the costs of the reference: a I

3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens
in their order of priority, by payment of the sums due

and to become due, the amount remaining due to be
verified by affidavit at the time of payment:

4. The residue, among the owners of the property

‘sold, according to their respective shares therein.

§943. The proceedings to ascertain the amount of

incumbrances, and to determine their priority as above

provided, or those herein authorized to determine the

rights of parties, to funds paid into court, must not de-

lay the sale, not affect any other party, whose rights
are not involved in such proceedings.

§ 944. ‘The proceeds of sale, and the securities taker’-I
by the referees, or any part thereof‘, may be distributed

by them to the persons entitled thereto, whenever the
court so directs. But in case no direction be given, all

_ such proceeds and securities must be paid into court, or

deposited as required by law, or directed by the court.

§ 945. When the proceeds of: sales of any shares or
parcels, belonging to persons, who have become parties

to the action, and who are known, are paid into court,
the action may be continued as between such parties,

for the determination of their respective claimsthereto,
whiehmust be ascertained and-adjudged‘ by--the court.
Further testimony may be taken, in court, or by a re-
feree, at the discretion of the-court, and the court may,
if necessary, require such parties to. present the facts
or law in controversy, by pleadings, as in an original
action.

§946. All sales of real property, made by referees
under this chapter, must be made by public auction to
the highest bidder, upon notice, published in the man-
ner required for the sale of real property on execution.
The notice must state the terms of sale, and if the pro-
perty or any partof it is to be sold, subject to a prior
estate, charge or specific rlien, that must be stated in
the notice.

§947. The court must, in the order for sale, direct
‘the’ terms of credit which may be allowed, for the pur-
chase money, of any portion of the premises of which

it may direct a sale on credit, and for that portion of
which the purchase money is required, by the provis-

4

ions hereinafter contained, to be invested for the bene-

fit of unknown owners, infants, parties out of the state,
or tenants in dower, or by the curtesy, or for life or

years, when the estate of such tenats is ordered to be
sold.

§ 948. The referees may take separate mortgages and
other securities, for the whole or convenient portions of

the purchase money, or such parts of the property as are
directed by the court to be sold on credit in the name

of the clerk of the court and his successors in oflice,

and for the shares of any known owner of full age, in
the name of such owner.

§ 949. When the estate of a tenant in dower, or by
the curtesy, or for life or years, in the whole or anypart
of the property in question has been admitted by the
parties, or ascertained by the court, to be existing at the
time of the order for sale, and the person entitled to such
estate, has been made a party to the action, such estate
may be iirst set off out of any part of the property, and
a sale make of such parcel, subject to the prior unsold
estate of such tenant therein, But if in the judgment
of the court, a due regard to the interests of all the par-
ties, require that such estate be also sold the sale may

be so ordered.

§ 950. If a sale of the property, including such estate,
be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant
or person passes thereby; and the purchaser, his

heirs and assigns, shall hold the property discharged

from all claims, by virtue of such estate or interest,
whether the same be to the individual share of a joint
tenant, or tenant in common, or to the whole or any

part of the property sold.

§ 951. The persons entitled to such estate in dower,
tenancy by the curtesy, or tenancy for life or years,

whose estate shall have been sold, are entitled to re-

ceive such sum in gross, as may be deemed upon

"principles of law applicable to annuities, a reasonable

satisfaction for such estate, and which the person so
entitled may consent to accept instead thereof; by an

instrument under seal, duly acknowledged or proved, in
in same manner as deeds for the purpose of record.

§ 952. If such consent be not given, at or before the
report of sale, the court must ascertain and determine
what proportion of the proceeds ‘of the sale, after de-
ducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable sum to
be invested, for the benefit of the person entitled to such
estate, in dower, by the curtesy, or for life ; and must
order the same to be deposited in court for that pur-

pose,
§ 953. The proportion of the proceeds of the sale to

be invested, must be ascertained and determined in the

several cases as follows:

1. If an estate in dower be included in the order of
sale, its proportion must be one-third of the proceeds of
the sale of the property, or of the sale of the individual

sharein such property, upon which the claim of dower
existed:

2. If an estate by the curtesy, or other estate for life
or years, be included in the order of sale, its proportion

court must provide for the protection of their rights in
,tl1,e,s=g1rne manner, .as far as may he, as if they were
kpown and had appeared.

§ 955. In all cases of sales in partition, when it ap-
pears that a married woman has an inchoate right of
dower in any of the property divided or sold, or that
any person has a vested or contingent future right or
estate therein, the court must ascertain and settle the
proportional value of such inchoate, contingent or ves-
ted right .or estate, according to the principles of law
applicable to annuities and survivorshipe, and mud
,direc_t such proportion of the proceeds of the sale to be
invested, secured, or paid over ‘in such manner, as to
protect the rights and interests of the parties.

§ 956. A'married‘woman'may release such right, in-
:terest or estate, to her husband, and acknowledge the
"same in the manner required by law, in respect to the
acknowledgment of deeds by married women, before
any oflicer authorized to take acknowledgment ofdeeds,
or if executed out of this state, before any officer resi-

ding in the state, district or county, where the acknowl-
edgment is made, who is "authorized to take the ac-
-knowledgment of deeds, to be recorded in this state.

Upon the release, the share of the proceeds of the sale,
arising from her contingent interest, must be paid to her
“husband, and theirelease, or the payment, investment,
‘or otherwise securing of, ashare of the proceeds of ‘a
sale, shall be a bar against such right,'e'st'ate, or claim.

’§ 957. The ‘terms of the sale tnust be made known
atthe time; and if the ‘prerrlises consist of distinct
farms, or lots, they must be sold separately.

C} 958. Neither of the referees, nor any person for the
benefit of either of them, can be interested in the pur-
chase ; nor can a guardian of an ‘infant party be interest-
ed inthe purchase of any real property, being the sub-
ject of the action, except for ‘the benefit of the infant.
All sales contrary to the provisions of this section are
void.

§ 959. After completing the sale, the referees must re-

port the same to the court, with a description of the
d:iil'ercnt parcels of -land sold to each purchaser, the

name of the purchaser, the price paid or secured,
the terms and conditions of the sale, and the securities

if any taken. The report must be tiled in the ofiice of
the clerk of the county, where the property is situated.

§ 960. If the sale be confirmed by the court, an order
must be entered, directing the referees to execute con-

veyances and take securities pursuant to such sale;
which they are hereby authorized to do. Such order
may also give directions to them respecting the dispo-
sition of the proceeds of the sale.

§ 961. When a party entitled to a share of the pro-
perty, or an incumbrancer entitled to have his lien paid
out of the sale, becomes a purchaser, the referees may
take his receipt for so much of the proceeds of the sale
as belongs to him, and must also pay over to the plain-
tiff or his attorney, and take his receipt for, the costs

and charges of the action.

§962. The conveyances must be recorded in the
county, where the premises are situated, and shall be
a bar against all persons interested in the property in
any way, who shall have been named as parties in the
action, and against all such parties and persons as were
unknown, if the summons have been served as is di-

rected by section 925, and against all persons claiming
from them or either of them.

§ 963. The conveyances shall also be a bar against
all persons having specific or general liens or incum-

brances by judgment, on any undivided share or interest
in the premises sold, who shall have been served with
notice as prescribed by section 939; and also against
all persons having specific liens on any undivided share

or interest therein, who shall have been made parties
to the action. But no creditor having such specific

lien can be affected by the sale or conveyance unless
he has been made party.

§ 964. When there are proceeds of sale, belonging to
an unknown owner, or to a person without the state,
who has no legal representative within it, or when
there are proceeds arising from the sale of an estate,
subject to the prior estate of a tenant in dower, or by
the curtesy, or tenant for life, or years, which are paid
into court, or deposited with an officer by order of
the court, the same must be invested in securities on
interest, for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto.

§ 965. When security for the proceeds of sale is ta-

ken, or when an investment of any such proceeds is
made, it must be done, except as herein otherwise pro-
vided, in the name of the clerk of the county, where
the papers are filed, and his successors in office, who
shall hold the same for the use and benefit of the

parties interested, subject to the order of the court.

§ 966. When security is taken by the referees on a
sale, and the parties interested in such security, by an

referees, if the committee, before the money is pahidj

into court, shall have executed, with sufficient sureties,
an undertaking, approved by a judge of the court, or if
the action be in the supreme court, by a county judge, 

that he will "faithfully discharge the trust reposed in

him, and will render a true and just account to the per-

conduct in the management and disposition of its busi-

ness or property:

2.= To suspend an oflicer from exercising his func-

tions, when it appears that he has abused his trust:

3. To compel the payment, or delivery, by an oflicer

where it may be done without injustice to the purcha-
ser or holder:

8 To prevent the improper alienation or disposition
of property, where there is reason to apprehend it will

be made.

But this jurisdiction does not deprive any corporate
body, or public oflicer, of visitatorial power over any

corporation.

§ 979. The jurisdiction conferred by the last section
can only be exercised on the application of an autho-

rized public officer, or of a creditor or stockholder, and

in other cases by motion.

§ 980. Whenever the affairs of a corporation are
closed by the supreme court, (except on a judgment,

obtained by a creditor for the satisfaction of a debt,)

in case of the insolvency of a bank or banking associ-
ation, the bill-holders thereof are entitled to preference

in payment over other creditors.

§ 981. A corporation may be adjudged to have forfeit-
ed its corporate rights, in either of the following cases:

1. When it has for one year neglected to pay its
notes, or other evidences of debt, or has, for that period,

2. When, having banking powers, or authority to
make loans on pledgvs or deposits, or to make insu-

rance, it violates any of the provisions of the act under
which it is incorporated, or of any other law.

may be restrained by injunction from the further exer-
cise of its corporate rights, and from receiving, paying,

transferring, or delivering any money or other property,

ceiver of the corporate property may be appointed.
Such injunction may be granted in an action brought
by the attorney general, in behalf of the state, to close

the business of the corporation, or by a creditor or

stockholder, in an action to have such forfeiture ad-

judged.

-§ 983. If the action ‘be "brought by a creditor of a
corporation, whose - directors, officers or stockholders
-are, by law, "personally liable for its debts, either abso-
iutely or in any contingency, theymay be made parties
to the action, either at it's -commencement or subse-
quently, fo‘r‘the purpose -of enforcingsuch liability.

§ 984. VVhe4n a judgment has been rendered in such
action, whether brought by the-attorney general, or by
a stockholder or creditor. and the directors, ofiicers or

stockholders are personally liable for the debts, and

have not been made parties, any creditor may com-

l mence an action, founded upon such judgment, to en-

force the liability; and in such action, the former judg-
ment is conclusive evidence of the matters the-rein

adjudged.

§ .985. Whenever an execution, issued on a judgment
against a corporation, is returned unsatisfied in -whole
or in part, by the sheriff of the county, where the prin-
cipal office or place of business of the corporation is

its affairs to be closed, its debts -collected, its property
converted into money, and its creditors paid in propor-
tion to the amount of their respective debts, in the or-
der _provided in a case of a voluntary dissolution -of a
corporation, except that the bill-holders of an insolvent
bank or banking association, must be (preferred, as -pro-
vided in section 980.

§ 986. When the property of the corporation is insuf-
ficient to discharge its debts, the court may compel
each stockholder to pay any amount, that may remain

unpaid, on the shares of stock held by him, or so much
thereof, as is necessary to satisfy the debts, and when
the officers or stockholders are personally liable for the
debts, and the property of the corporation, together with

the amount unpaid on the stock, is insuflicient to dis-
charge its debts, the court may compel contribution

from the ofiicers or stockholders, who may be liable to
satisfy the balance of the debts, from each according

to his liabilzty.

§987. In any proceeding, pursuant to this chapter,
to close the affairs of a corporation, the cotirt may, on
application of a stockholder, oflicer or creditor, restrain
further proceedings by any creditor, in an action against
the corporation, so far as may be -proper, in order to
prevent the waste of the funds by unnecessary litiga-
tion ; and may by a notice, served or published as the
court may direct, require all creditors to present and
prove their claims, or become ‘parties to the action,
within a reasonable time, or be precluded from the
benefit of any distribution, which may be made before
such claim is proved.

under the laws of, any other state, government or coun-.

tion:

ted, within this state.

'2. That such property has perished ‘or bée'n- last,
Without the fault of such executors or adiiliiiisltrators’;
or that it has been fairly sold by them at private

or that, since the return of the inventory, such property
has deteriorated or increased in value. In such action.
the defendants cannot be charged for any  in
avctidn, specihed in their -inventory», unless it appear
that they have been bollected, or knight with due dill‘
gence, have been collected.

§ 998. No person is liable to an action as executor bl’
 own wrong, for having taken, received, or interfered
with, the property of a deceased person; but is i'e'spoii-

' § 999. The next of kin of a deceased person are liable
to an action by a creditor of the estate, to recover the dis-
tributive shares, received out of such estate, or so much

-§ 1000. In such action, the plaintiff may recover the
value of all the assets received by all the defendants in

be made from such amount, on account of there being.

other relatives to whom assets have also been de-
livered.

§ 1001. Any one of the next of kin, against whom a

recovery is bad pursuant to the last section, may

ly, or against any of them separately, for a just and equal
contribution, and may recover of each defendant such
an amount as shall be in the same proportion to the
whole sum collected of the plaintiff, as the value of the

assets delivered to such defendant bore to the value of

all the assets delivered to all the relatives of the de-

qeased.

.plaintiff cannot recover unless he shows:

§ 1002. Legatees are liable to an action by acreditor

administrator of the deceased, to his next of kin: or "

‘I

2. That the value of such assets has been recovered

by some other creditor: or

3. That such assets are not sufficient to satisfy the
demand of the plaintiff:

And in the last case, he can recover only the deficien-

-cy. The whole amount which the plaintiff can recover,

must be apportioned among all the legatees of the tes-

-tator, in proportion to the amounts of their legacies re-

spectively, and his proportion can only be recovered of
each legatee.

§ 1003. If an action be brought against several next

of kin jointly, or against several legatees jointly, for

assets delivered to them, and a recovery be had against

among the several defendants, in proportion to the
amount of the debt or damages recovered against each

of them.

§ 1004. In case of a judgment against several next
of kin of a testator, or against several legatees, the

payment or satisfaction of the amount recovered

fendant, and exonerates him and his property from_ the

parties to the action.

V’. § 100_6. But’ the heirs are not liable for the, debt,
unless it appear that the personal assets of the deceased
were not suflicient to discharge it, or that after due
proceedings before the proper surrogate’s court, the

creditor has been unable to ‘collect the debt, from the
personal representatives of the deceased; or from hi

next of kin or legatees. If the personal assets were
suflicient topay a part of? the debt, or-in case a part
thereof shall have been collected, as mentioned; in the
lam eeetiga, the heirs of eueh. diseased person are. liable
tvr the.£ee1sue

§ 1007. But the last section does not-affect the liabil-
ity of hei-rs for a debt of‘ their ancestor, where such debt
was, by his will, expressly charged exclusively on the
real property descended to such heirs, or where such
debt is by the will expressly directed to be paidout of
the 1$eal.pt9pBrt}': deseendeds beferearesertting to: the per-
dmal.-property;

§ 1808. In cases where the next ofliin, legatees, heirs,
and devise-es» are liable fer the debts -of their ancestors:
as herein provided, they must give‘ preference in the
payment‘ of the same, and ‘are liable therefor, in the fol?
lbw-ing order :*

1. Debts entitled to a ‘preference under the laws

the United States: L A,’
2. Judgments against the ancestor or testator accord-
ing to the priority thereof respectively :
3‘. Recognizances; bonds, sealed instruments, notes,‘
bills, and unliquidated demands and accounts. Y

§ 1009. No preference can be given by any next 
kin,,1egatee, heir or devisee, to one debt over another
of the same class, except one specified in the second

subdivision of the last section ; nor is a debt,. due 
payable, entitled to a preference over a debt not due;
nordocs tliencommencement of 'an' action against any
next of kin, legatee, heir or devisee, tar the recovery of
a debt, entitle it to a preference over others of the same

class:

§ 1010. The next.of kin,. legatees, heirs and devisees,
may show that there are debts of a prior class unsatis;

tied‘; or that there are unpaid debts of the same class

with that on which the action is brought; and if it ap.-
pear, that the value of the personal property delivered

to them, or of the real estate descended or devised to
them, does not exceed the debts of a prior class judg-

ment must be rendered in their favor.

_. § 1011 If the personal property delivered to such next

of kin or legatees, or if the real estate descended or
devised to such heirs and devisees, exceed the amount

of debts which are entitled to a preferenceover the debt
for which the action is brought, judgment must be rene
dered against them only for such a sum as shall be a
just proportion to the other debts, of the same class with
that on which the action is brought.

§ 1012. If a debt of a class prior to that on which the
action is brought, or of the same class, shall have been
paid by any next of kin, legatees, heirs or devisees, they
may prove such payment, and the amount of the debts
so paid must be estimated in ascertaining the amount

to be recovered, in the same manner as if such debts

were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in the last

two sections. ,

§ 1013. If it appear that the real property so descend-
ed, was not aliened by the heir, at the time of the com-

mencement of the action, or if the heir confess the
claim, and show What real property has descended to
him, the court must order that the debt of the plaintiff,
or the proportion thereof which he is entitled to recover,

be levied of the real property so descended, and not
otherwise; and every judgment rendered in such ac-
tion has preference, as a lien on the real property de-
scended, to any judgment obtained against such heir

personally, for a debt or demand in his own right.

‘§ 1014. When it appears, in the action, that before
the commencement thereof; the heir has aliened the
real property descended to him, or any part thereof‘, he
shall be personally liable for the value of the property
so aliened, and judgment may be rendered therefor and
execution awarded, as in actions for his own ‘debts. But
no real property aliened in good faith by an heir, be-
fore action commenced against him, is liable to execu-

. . i . .
tron, or in any manner affected by a Judgment against
him.

§ 1015. In actions brought against several heirs
jointly, or several devisees jointly, the amount, which
the plaintiff recovers, must be apportioned, among all

the heirs of the ancestor, or among all the Jdevisees of
the tcstator, in proportion to the value of the real pro-

perty descended or devised, and such proportion only
can be recovered of each heir or legatee. ‘

§ 1016. Devisees made liable, by the foregoing pro-
visions of this chapter, to the creditors of their tcstator,
are not so liable, unless it appear that his personalassets

and the real property of the testator descended to his
heirs were insufficient to discharge the debt; or unless
it appear, that after due proceedings before the s.u1,'ro-
gate, the creditor has been unable to recover the debt,
or any part thereof, from the personal representatives
of the tcstator, or from his next of kin_or legatees, or
from his heirs.

§1017. In either of the cases specified in the last
section, the amount of the deficiency of the personal
assets, and: of the real property descended, to. satisfy
the debt of the plaintiff, and the amount which such
plaintiff may have failed to recover from the personal
representativesof the testator, his next of kin, legatees
and heirs, may be recovered of , the devisees of such
testator, to the extent of the real property devised to

them respectively.

§ 1018. But the last two sections do not affect the
liability of devisees, for a debt of their testator, where

such debt was, by his will, expressly charged exclusive-
ly upon the real property devised, or by the terms of
the will made payable exclusively by such devisee, or
made payable out of the real property devised, before
resorting to the personal property or to any other real

property descended or devised.

§ 1019. The provisions of this chapter, with regard
to heirs, and to proceedings by and against them, and

to judgments and executions against them, are applica-
ble to actions and proceedings against devisees; and
they must, in like manner, be sued jointly.

§: 1020. In cases-wzhere, by the-provisions:of'any<sttat1
ate, a-child born after»the- malningv of a will, is‘-entitled
Itoasuoceed to«a portion of the -testa,t!or’=s' real and pen

-ggnaldpropertyw, suchtch-ildshall have thefsameriglits

and remedies to compel a distribution of the personal
property and a partition of the real property, as are pro-

vided for next of kin and for heirs; and shall, in all

respects, be liable, in the same manner and to the same
extent, to the creditors of his ancestor, in respect to
the personal property delivered to him, and the real

property descended to him, as are herein prescribed ‘m
relation to next of kin and heirs; and such child may
recover of the legatees and devisees. who. may have re-
ceived or taken any real or personal property of the
testator, the share or portion thereof ‘to which he may
be entitled.

§ 1021. The provisions of the ‘last’ two sections rela-
tiveto a child, born after the making of a Will, apply
equally to every person, who being a witness to a will,
is entitled, by the provisions of any statute, to recover
a portion of the real or personal property, of the testa-
tor, from the legatees and devisees named in such

will...

§ 1025. A judgment in favor of a party for one de-’
linquency, does not preclude the same, or another party‘,

against a public officer and his sureties, amounting in
the aggregate to a sum greater than that, for which the
sureties are liable, the court must, on their application,

of their respective liabilities, and may cause the same
to be applied on the judgments or executions, in pro-
portion to such amounts.

1. The complaint by the plaintiff, stating the cause

of action :

2. The answer by the defendant, stating the grounds
of the defence:

3. \Vhen the answer sets up a counter-claim, the ne-

ply by the plaintiff.

§ 1086. The pleadings may be oral, except when the

title to real property is brought in question, or they may
be in writing; if oral, the substance of them must be

entered by the justice in his docket ; if in writing, they
must be filed in his office, and a reference to them
made in the docket. They are not required to be in any

particular form, but must be such, as to enable a per-
son of common understanding to know what is in-

tended.

§ 1087. The complaint must state in a plain and di-
rect manner, the facts constituting the cause of action.

§ 1088. The answer may contain a denial of any of
the material facts stated in the complaint, which the
defendant believes to be untrue, and also a statement,
in a plain and direct manner, of any other facts, con-
stituting a defence, or a counter-claim upon which an

action might be brought by the defendant against the
plaintiff in a justice’s court.

§ 1089. When the answer contains a counter-claim,
the plaintiff may reply, denying any of the material
allegations relating thereto.

§ 1090. A statement in an answer or reply, that the
party has not sufficient knowledge or information in
respect to a particular allegation in the previous plead-

ing of the adverse party, to form a belief, is equivalent

to a denial.

§1091. When the cause of action or counter-claim
arises upon an account or instrument for the payment

of money only, it is sufficient for the party to deliver
the account or instrument to the court, and to state,
that there is due to him thereon, from the adverse par-
ty, a specified sum, which he claims to recover or set

off. The court may at the time of the pleading, require

that such writing or account be exhibited to the inspec-
tion of the adverse party, with liberty to copythe same;
or if not so exhibited, may prohibit its being afterwards

given in evidence.

§ 1092. Every complaint, answer, or reply, must be
verified by the oath of the party pleading, or if he be

not present, by the oath of his agent or attorney, to the
eifect that he believes it to be true. The verification

must be oral or in writing, in conformity with the plead-

ing verified.

§ 1093. Every material allegation in a complaint, or
relating to a counter-claim in an answer, not denied by
the pleading of the adverse party, must, on the trial be

taken to be true, except, that when a defendant, who
has not been served with a copy of the complaint with

the summons, fails to appear and answer, the plaintiff,

cannot recover, without proving his case.

§ 1094. Either party may object to a pleading of his

adversary, or to any part thereof; that it is not suflicienly

explicit to enable him to understand it, or that it con’-
tains no cause of action or defence, although it be tai-

ken as true.

If the ‘court deem‘ the‘ objection we-11 founded, it must’

order the pleading to be amended, and, if the party re-
fuse to amend, the defective pleading must be disre-
garded.

§1095. A variance between the proof on the trial,-.
and the allegations in a pleading, must be disregarded

as immaterial, unless the court be satisfied, that the

adverse party has been misled to his prejudice thereby.

§ 1096. The pleadings may be amended, atany time
before the trial, or during the trial, orupon appeal, to
supply any deficiency or omissions in the allegations or
denial, necessary to support tl-reaction or defencemvhea
by such amendment-, substantial justice will be promo-
ted. If the amendment be made after the issue, and
it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court. by
oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse

party, in consequence of such amendment, an adjourn-
ment must be granted. The court may also, in its dis-

cretion, require as a condition of an amendment, the
payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by
the court, not exceeding three dollars; but such pay-

ment cannot be required, unless an adjournment is
made necessary by the amendment; nor can an amend-

nient be allowed after a witness is sworn on the trial,
when an adjournment thereby will be made necessary.

§ 1097. When, by the defendant’s answer, the title
to real property is brought in question, such a‘nswer‘
mustbe in writing, subscribed by the defendant or his=
attorney.

. §1098 If the defendant have been arrested, such
answer must be disregarded, unless the defendant also
it'n‘rnedia'tely deliver to" the justice 3: written undertak-
ihg,- executed by the defendant, and one sufhcienti
surety ; of if the defendant be’ absent, by two sufficient"
siireties, approved  the" justice’; to‘ the effect, that’

costs before the justice being added as disbursements.
The plaintiff may, however, by a notice served within-
twenty days thereafter, decline to prosecute his action

in the supreme court; in such case, the claim shall be
deemed abandoned, and no costs shall be recovered

against him in the supreme court.

§ 1100. The defendant is not at liberty to give evidence,
by which the question of title to real property is raised
on the trial before a justice. And when from the.plain-

titf’s own showing, on the trial, it appears that the de-
termination of the action will necessarily involve the
decision of a question of title. to real property, the jus-
tice must dismiss the action, with costs, stating on his
docket the reason therefor; but such dissmissal shall
not preclude the plainiff from an action in the supreme

court for the same cause.

63 1101. When the title to real property is set forth in
the answer as provided in section 1097, or appears on
the trial as provided in the last section, and there are
other causes of action in the complaint, not affected by
the question of title, the order to transfer or to dismiss
the action, shall not include such other causes; but as
to them, the action must be severed, and tried before
the justice in the same manner, as if the question of
title had not been raised.

§ 1102. Upon the return day, if a jury be required, or
if the justice be actually engaged in other otlicial busi-

ness, he may adjourn the trial without the consent of
either party, as follows:

1. Where a party, who is not a resident of the coun-

ty, is in attendance; or where the defendant is in at-
tendance under arrest; the adjournment not to exceed

twenty-four hours; and the defendant, if under arrest,
to continue in custody:

2. In other cases, not to exceed five days, unless by
consent of parties.

If the trial be not adjourned, it must take place im-
mediately upon the return of the summons.

§ 1103. The trial may be adjourned by consent, or up-
on application of either party, without the consent of

the other, for a period not exceeding eight days, as fol-
lows:

1. The party asking the adjournment must, if requir-

ed by his adversary, prove by his own oath or other-
wise, that he cannot, for want of material testimony,

which he expects to procure, safely proceed to trial:

2. If the application be on the part of the plaintiff,
and the defendant be under arrest, an adjournment for

more than twenty-four hours, discharges the defendant

from custody, but the action may proceed notwith-
standing: and the defendant shall be subject to arrest
on the execution in the same manner as if he had not

been so discharged :

3. If the application be on the part of a defendant
under arrest, before it can be granted, he must execute
an undertaking, with one or more suflicient sureties to
be approved by the justice, as follows: If the arrest be
for a cause speciiiedin the first four subdivisions of sec-
tion 1071, or in the sixth, the undertaking must be to the
effect, that he will appear at the return day, and not de-
part from the court until duly discharged, or until after

the trial and jud gment, and after a reasonable opportunity
to arrest him on execution issued upon the judgment, if

any be obtained against him. Ifthe arrest be for a cause
specihed in subdivision 6,of that section, the undertaking
must be to the effect, that no part of the property of the
defendant, liable to be taxen on execution, shall be
removed, secreted, assigned, or otherwise disposed of,

except for the necessary support, for the time, of him-
self and family, until the plaintiff ’s demand be satis-
fied, or until the expiration of ‘ten days after the judg-

ment, if any be obtained against him in the action:

4. Either party applying for an adjournment, must

‘also, if required by the adverse party, consent that the

testimony of any witnesses of such adverse party who
are in attendance, be then taken by deposition before the

justice, which must accordingly be done; and the tes-

timony so taken may be read on the trial with the same

effect, and subject to the same objections, as if the wit-
ness were produced.

§ 1104. An adjournment may be had, either at the
time of joining the issue, or at any subsequent time to
which the cause may stand adjonmed, on application
of either party, for a period longer than eight days, but
not to exceed ninety days from the time of the return
-of the summons, upon compliance with the provisions
of the last section, and upon proof; by the oath of the
party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the justlhe, that
such party cannot be ready for trial before the time to
which he desires an adjournment, for the want of ma-

terial evidence, describing it, that the delay has not
been made necessary by any act or negligence on his
part, since the action was commenced, and that he ex-
pects to procure the evidence at the time stated by him.

§ 1105. If the plaintiff fail to appear at the return day

of the summons and make his complaint, the action

must be dismissed. If the defendant fail to appear .at
the return day of the summons, or if either party fail,
to attend at a day to which the trial has been adjourn-

ed, or fail to make the necessary pleading or proof on
his part, the case may nevertheless proceed at the re-
quest of the adverse party; and judgment must be giv-

en in conformity with the pleadings and proofs.

joumed, and if adjourned, then at the time to which
the trial is adjourned, the justice must proceed to draw
from the jurors summoned, the names of persons to
constitute the jury for the trial of the issue. Six jurors
constitute a jury, but by consent of parties, a less num-

ber may act.

§ 1108. If a suiiicient number of ‘competent and in-
different jurors do not attend, the justice must direct

-others to be summoned by a constable, from the vicini.-__
ty, sufficient to complete the jury.

'§ 1109. The ballots containing names of jurorsnot
summoned, if any, and of those summoned, but not

drawn, must beireturned by the justice to the drawn ju-
ry box, except that such of them as contain the names

of persons, not liable to serve as jurors, must be destroy-
ed. The ballots containing‘ the names of the jurors,
who serve, must not be returned to the sanre box from
which they were taken, until all the names have been
drawn out. As often‘ as that happens, the whole num-

ber must be returned to the undrawn jury ‘box, to be
drawn as in the first instance. ‘ ' ''

§1110. Before a party can be entitled to a jury, he

must deposit with the justice the sum of three dollam,
for jury fees, from which the justice must refund to the

party the fees of all jurors who do not attend, and those
not refunded must be included in the judgment as part

of the costs, in case the party calling the jury recover
judgment.

§ 1111. No adjournment can be granted after the re-
turn of the jury, unless the party requiring the same, in
addition to the other conditions imposed on him, depos-
it with the justice, to be immediately paid to the jurors
attending, the sum of twenty-five cents each, which
amount is in no case to be included as part of the costs

in the judgment- After the adjournment the jurors
must attend at the time and place appointed, without

further notice, and the fees deposited when the jury was

demanded, with the justice, may remain in his hands
until the jury are impanelled, and must be then paid

over to them.

§ 1112. If either party object to the competency:__of
a juror the question thereon must be tried in a summa-
ry manner by the justice, who may examine the juror

or other witnesses on oath.

Inez»; but if the objection be taken and overruled, it is?

1_115. \Vhen the defendant fails to appear and an-
swer, judgment must be given for the plaintiff, as fol-
lows:

1. iWhere a copy of the complaint and account, or
instrument, has been served personally with the sum-

mons, as prescribed in section 1069, judgment must be

given without further evidence for the sum specified in
the summons:

2. In other cases the justice must hear the evidence
of the plaintiff, and render judgment for such sum only

as shall appear by the evidence to be just; but in no

case to exceed the amount speciiied in the summons_

§ll16. Upon issue joined, if a jury trial be not de-

manded, the justice must hear the evidence, and decide
all questions of fact and of law, and render judgment
accordingly.

I § 1117. Upon a. verdict, the justice must immediately
render judgment accordingly. When the trial is by

the justice, judgment must be entered immediately
after the close of the trial, if the defendant has been
arrested, or his property attached: in other cases, it
must be entered either at the close of the trial, or, if

the justice then desire further time to consider, on the
fourth day thereafter, both days inclusive.

§ 1118. When the amount found due to either party
exceeds the sum, for which the justice is authorized to
enter judgment, such party may remit the excess, and

judgment may be entered for the residue.

§ 1119. In an action arising on contract, when there
is no counter-claim, if the plaintiff fail to recover
judgment for an amount equal to that stated in his

summons, he cannot recover costs.

§ 1120. If the- defendant, at any timeibafare the trinl,
offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken against
him for a specified sum, the plaintiff mayimmediately
have judgment therefbr, with the costs then accrued.
But if he do not accept such offer before the trial», and
fail to recover in the action a sum equal to the 0&1‘,

he cannot recover costs accrued after the offer: but
costs must be adjudged against him, and if he recover,
deducted from his recovery. But the offer, and failure
to accept it, cannot be given in evidence, to affect the

recovery, otherwise than as to costs, as above provided.

§ 1121. When a- judgment is rendered, in a case
where the defendant is subject to arrest and imprison-
ment thereon, it must be so -stated in the judgment, and
entered in his docket.

§1122. The justice, on the demand of a party in
whose favor judgment is rendered, must give him a
transcript thereof} which may be filed and docketed in

the office of the clerk of the county where the judgment
was rendered. The time of the receipt of the trans-

cript by the county clerk, must be noted by him there-
on, and entered in the docket; and from that time, the

judgment creates a lien in the same manner, as a judg-

ment of the supreme court. Upon a. transcript of such
docket, certified by the clerk of the county, and filed in
any other county, the judgment may be there docketed
with the same effect, from the time of filing and dock-
eting in that county. The judgment so. docketed, and
the enforcement thereof, are subject to the control of
the county court of the county where it was first dOQk'.-

eted, as a judgment of that court. But a judgment for
less than twenty-five dollars, so docketed, is not a lien

upon, and cannot be enforced against real property.

@1123. Execution for the enfhrcement of a judgment
in a justice’s court, except when it has been docketed

in the county clerk’s office, may be issued by the justice
before whom the judgment was rendered, or by his suc-
cessor in office, on the application of the party entitled

thereto, at any time within five years from the entry of
judgment.

otlicer to be executed. It must intelligibly refer to the
judgment, by stating the names of the parties, and the
name of the justice before whom, and of the county
and town where, and the time when, it was rendered;

the amount of the judgment; and, if less than the
whole is due, the true amount due thereon. It must
require the constable substantially as follows:

1. If it be a case where the defendant cannot be ar-
restsd, it must direct the officer to collect the amount
of the judgment out of the personal property of the
debtor, and to paygthe same to the party entitled
thereto:

2. If it be a case where the defendant may be ar-
rested, in addition to the foregoing, it must direct the

oiiicer, if suiiicient property of the defendant liable to

the execution cannot be found to satisfy the judgment,
that he arrest the debtor, and commit him to the jail

of the county, until he pay the judgment, or be dis-
charged according to law:

3. It must further, in all cases, direct the otlicer to
make return ofthe execution, and a certificate thereon,

showing the manner in which he has executed the

same, in sixty days from the time of his receipt thereof.

{} 1125. Upon an execution on a judgment against
joint debtors, upon one or more of whom the summons
was not served, the execution must contain a direction

to collect the amount out of the joint property of all the

defendants, or the separate property of the persons up-
on whom the summons was served, to’ be specified by

name. If such judgment be also such that the de-‘
fendants are subject to arrest thereon, the justice must

further specify the names of those defendants, served
with the summons, who may be arrested for want of

property.

§ 1126. A constable may, at his peril, omit to arrest
a debtor; or after arrest, suffer him to go at large be-
fore the return day; subject only to his liability for an
escape, or for omitting to arrest, if he fail to have either
the money or the person of the debtor in custody at the

expiration of the sixty days.

§ 1127. When an execution directs the arrest of the
debtor for want of suflicient personal chattels, if there
be not sufficient subject to levy known to the oflicer, or
if upon demand by the officer of the debtor, he fail to

produce sufficient property, the ofiicer may without fur-
ther delay arrest the defendant. When arrested, the

defendant must be conveyed to the common jail of the

county, and there be kept in custody until the execu-
tion with costs be paid, or he be discharged by due
course of law.

§ 1128. The debtor committed as provided in the last
section, may be held in prison ten days: and if he be
a person without a family, for which he provides, one
day in addition, for every dollar over ten due on the

§ I 130. An execution may, at the request of the plain-
tiff, be renewed before the expiration of sixty days from
the time of its issue, by the word “ renewed” written
thereon, with the date thereof, and subscribed by the
justice. Such renewal has the effect of an original
issue; and may be repeated as often as may be. neces-
sary. If an execution be returned unsatisfied, another
may be afterwards issued.

\

§ 1131. A debtor cannot be arrested, nor his property
sold on execution, after sixty days from its issue or re-

newal; but property levied on within the sixty days,
may be sold after a renewal.

§1132. A constable is liable to the party in whose

favor an execution is issued to him, for the amount
thereof, in the following cases:

1. When he suffers sixty days to elapse, without
making a true return thereof to the justice, and paying

to him or to the party entitled, the money collected
thereon by him:

2. When he wilfully or carelessly omits to levy upon
property; or if the debtor be liable to arrest, to arrest
and imprison him, within sixty days; or having arrest-
ed the debtor, fails to commit him to the county jail,
within the sixty days.

§ 1133. Upon a justice’s judgment docketed in a
county clerk’s office, execution can only be issued by
the clerk with whom the transcript is filed, or by the
plaintiff in person: and it may be sent to one or more
counties where the judgment is docketed. It must
conform substantially to the execution issued by a jus-
tice, except that it must state the time when the judg-
ment was docketed in the county from which it is is-
sued, and must be directed to the sheriff; and may di-
rect, that for want of sufficient personal property, the

debt be made out of the real property of the debtor.

same may be reviewed by the supreme court; and re-
quiring thepaty, in the mean time, to desist from fur-
ther proceedings in the matter to be reviewed.

words requiring the stay, may be omitted from the writ.

discretion of the court.

§_ 1274. The effect of the writ is to remove, not the
record, but the transcript thereof; therefore, the power

of the inferior court or officer is not suspended, not the
proceedings stayed, unless an order to that effect be in-

serted in the writ.

§ 1275. The writ may be granted, wherever specially
authorized by this code, and also in all cases where an
inferior tribunal, board, or officer, exercising judicial

functions, is alleged to have exceeded the jurisdiction

of such tribunal, board, or ofiicer; and where there is
no appeal, nor, in the judgment of the court, any other
plain, speedy and adequate remedy.

§ 1276. Except where otherwise expressly provided
by this code or another st-atute, the review upon this
writ cannot be extended further, than to determine
whether the inferior tribunal, board, or ofiicer, has re-
gularly pursued the authority of such tribunal, board*or
officer.

..

§ 1277. The Writ may be directed to such tribunal,
board, or oflicer, or to any other person having the cus-

tody of the record or proceedings to be certi£ed.

§ 1278. The motion for the writ must be made upon
affidavit, and the court may require a notice of the ap-

plication to be given to the adverse party, or may grant

an order to shew cause why it should not be allowed,
‘or may grant the writ without notice.

§ 1279. The allowance of the writ must be endorsed
thereon, signed by the judge granting 1t, and the writ
must be served in the same manner, as a summons in

a‘: civil action, except where otherwise expressly provi-
ded.

§ 1280. If the return to the writ be defective, the
court may orderva further return to be made. When a

full return has been made, the court must proceed to
hear the parties, or such of them as may attend for that

purpose, and may thereupon give judgment, either af-
firming or annulling the proceedings below.

§ 1281. A copy of the judgment, signed by the clerk,
entered upon, or attached to, the Writ and return, con-

§ 1284. This writ ought not to be issued, in any case
where there is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy,
in the ordinary course of the law. It is issued, on the
information of the party beneficially interested.

§ 1285. The writ is either alternative or peremptory.
The alternative writ must state concisely the facts

showing the obligation of the defendant to perform t e
act, and his omission to perform it, and command h’

that immediately after the receipt of the writ, or a
some other specified time, he do the act required to be .

performed, or show cause before the supreme court, at
a specified time and place, why he has not done so;
and that he then and there return the writ, with his
certificate of having done as he is commanded. The

peremptory writ must be in a similar form, except that

the words requiring the defendant to show cause why

he has not done as commanded, must be omitted.

§ 1286. When the right to require the performance
of the act is clear, and it is apparent, that no valid ex-
cuse can be ‘given for not performing it, a peremptory

mandate may be allowed in the first instance. In all

other cases, the alternative writ must be first issued.

§ 1287. The motion for the writ, the allowance, and
the service thereof; and the enforcement of obedience

thereto, must be in the same manner, as in case of the

writ of review.

such further day as the court may allow, the party, on
whom the writ shall have been served, may show

cause, by answer made, in the same manner as an an-

swer to a complaint in a civil action.

I

§ 1289. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandate

must be allowed against the defendant. If an answer
be made, containing new matter, the same shall not in

any respect conclude the plaintiff, who may on the
trial or other proceedings avail himself of any valid
‘objection to its sufliciency, or may countervail it by
‘proof, either in direct denial or by way of avoidance.

§ 1290. No other pleading, or written allegation, is
allowed than the writ and answer. These .are the

pleadings in the case, and have the same effect, and

are to be construed and may be amended, in the same
manner, as pleadings in a civil action, and the issues

thereby joined must be tried, and the further proceed-
ings thereon had in the same manner, as in a civil

action.

{} 1291. Issues joined in the case, must be tried inthe

county where the material facts set forth in the man-
date are alleged to have occurred.

§1292. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he
shall recover the damages which he shall have sustain-
ed, to be ascertained by the court or a jury, or by re-
ferees, as in a civil action, together with costs and
charges; and a peremptory mandate must also be
awarded without delay.

_, ,§ 1293. _A recovery of damages by virtue of this chap-
ter, against a party, who shall have made a return to a
writ of mandate, is a bar to any other action against
the same party, for the making of such return.

§ 1294. Whenever a peremptory mandate is directed
by a public oflicer, body, or board, commanding the per’

formance of any public duty, specially enjoined by 13W»
if it appear to the court that such officer, or any mem-
ber of such body, or board, has, without just excuse»

refused or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined»
the court may impose a hue, not exceeding tW0 bun’
dred and £fty dollars, upon every such oflicer or men!‘
ber of such body or board. Such line, when collected-

must be paid into the treasury; and the payment
thereof is a bar to an action, fbr any penalty incurred

enjoined.

the commitment be irregular, he may be forthwith re-
manded to the custody, or placed under the restraint,

of the officer or person so entitled.

§ 1328. Until judgment be given upon the return, the
party may be either committed to the custody of the

§ 1329. When it appears from the return to the writ,
that the party is in custody on an order or process,
under which another person has an interest in con-
tinuing his imprisonment, or restraint, no order can be
made for his discharge, until the party so interested,
othis attorney, has had the same notice of the return
asis required to be given of motions in the supreme
court.

§1330. When it appears from the return, that the.

party is detained upon a criminal accusation, the court

ney of the county, where the party is detained.

§°1331. The party produced, on the return of a writ
of deliverance, may deny any of the material facts set
forth in the return, or may allege any fact, to show,
either that his imprisonment or restaint is unlawful,

or that he is entitled to his discharge; which alle-
gation or denial must be on oath; and, thereupon, the
court or judge must proceed in a summary way, to

hear such evidence as may be produced, in support
of the imprisonment or detention, or against the same,

and to dispose of the party, as the justice of the case
may require.

§ 1332. Whenever, from the sickness or infirmity of
the party, he cannot, without danger, be produced, the
person in whose custody he is, may state that fact in
his return to the writ, verifying the same by his oath;

return be otherwise suflicient, the court or judge must

proceed to decide on the return, and to dispose of
the matter in the same manner, as if the party had

been produced.

§ 1333. Whenever an application is made for a writ
of deliverance, according to the provisions of this

-chapter, if it appear, upon the face of the application,

tion of the party, may be dispensed with though such

production be asked, and the writ be issued accord-
inglr- "

§ 1334. If it appear, that the party detained is ille-

gally imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, judgment

must be given that he be forthwith discharged : other-

wise the application must be dismissed.

person, the court or judge before whom the same was
returnable, may, before final decision, issue a new writ,
requiring the production of the person.

§l336. Obedience to a judgment, for the dis~
charge of a person restrained of his liberty, pursuant

to the provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the
court or judge, by proceedings for a contempt, in the
same manner, and with the same eifect, as for a ne-
glect to make return to a writ of deliverance; and the

person found guilty of such disobedience, shall forfeit
to the party aggrieved, one thousand dollars, in addi-
tion to any special damages which he may have sus-

tained.

§ 1337. No sheriff or other o£”1cer is liable to a civil
action, for obeying such judgment of discharge.

. ° 6; 1338. No person who has been discharged, upon a

writ of deliverance, pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, can be again imprisoned, restrained, or kept in
custody, for the same cause; but it is not to be deemed

the same cause.

1. If he have been discharged from a commitment
on a criminal charge, and be afterwards committed for

the same offence, by the legal order or process of the

court, wherein he is bound, by recognizance or under-
taking, to appear, or in which he is indicted or con-

victed for the same offence: or, o

2. If, after. a discharge for a defect of evidence, or for
a material defect in the commitment, in a criminal case,
the party be again arrested, on suflicient evidence, and
committed by legal process, for the same offence : or,

3; If, in a civil action, the party have been discharged

for any illegality in the judgment or process, herein be-
fore speciiied, and be afterwards imprisoned by legal
authority, for the same cause of action: or,

4. If, in a civil action, he have been discharged from
commitment on an order of arrest, and be afterwards

committed on execution, in the same action, or on an
order of arrest in another action, after such first action

has been dismissed.

§ 1339. If any person, either solely or as a member
of a court, in the execution of a judgment, order, or
process, knowingly recommit, imprison, or restrain of his

liberty, for the same cause, except as provided inithe
last section, any person so discharged, or knowingly

"direct or assist therein, he shall forfeit to the party ag-

grieved one thousand dollars, and be also guilty of a
misdemeanor.

§ 1340. Any person having in his custody or power,

or under his restraint, a party, who, by the provisions
of this chapter, would be entitled to a writ of deliver-

ance or for whose relief a writ of deliverance has been

been issued, who, with intent to elude the service of
the writ, or to avoid‘the effect thereof, transfers the par-

'ty to the custody, or places him under the power or

-control, of another, or conceals or changes the place of

his confinement, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 1341. Every person who knowingly assists, in the
violation of the last section, is guilty of .a misde-

'meanor.

§ 1342. Every person, convicted of an offence under
either of the last four sections, may be punished by

"fine and imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the

‘court, in which he is convicted; but such fine cannot
exceed one thousand dollars, nor such imprisonment

six months.

§ 1343. Whenever it appears by satisfactory evidence
that any person is held in illegal confinement, and
that there is reason to believe, that he will be carried
out of the state, or suffer irreparable injury before he

can be relieved, by the issuing of a writ of deliverance,
any court or judge, authorized to issue such writ, may
issue a warrant, directed to any sheriff, constable or
other person, reciting the facts, and commanding such

otlicer or person to take the party and forthwith to bring
him before the court or judge.

, §1344. When the evidence, mentioned in the last
section, is also suflicient to justify an arrest of the per-
son having the party in his custody, as for a criminal
offence committed in the taking or detaining of the

party, the warrant must also contain an order for the
arrest of such person for the offence.

§ 1345.. Any officer or person, to whom the warrant
is directed, must execute the same, by bringing the
prisoner therein named, and the person who detains
-him, if so commanded by the warrant, before the court
or judge issuing it ; and thereupon the person, detaining
the party, must make a return in the same manner, and
the same proceedings must be had thereon as if a writ
of deliverance had been issued in the first instance.

§'1'346. If the person, having the party in his custody;
be brought before the court or judge, as for a criminal

offence, he must be examined, committed, bailed or
discharged, by the court or judge in the same manner
qsinother ‘criminal cases of the like nature.

§ 1347. Any officer or other person refusing to deliver
a copy of an order, warrant, process, or other authority,
by which he detains a person, to any one who demands

it, and tenders the fees therefor, shall forfeit two hun-
dred dollars to the person so detained.

§ 1348. Whenever a writ of deliverance is required,
in any action or matter, civil or criminal, to which the

people of this state are a party, the application therefor
may be made by the attorney general, or by the district

attorney having charge thereof, and whenever so issued,
the court or judge allowing it, must state in the en-

dorsement of the allowance, that it was issued on such
application.

§ 1349. A writ of deliverance must be served by an
elector of this I state, and the service thereof is not

deemed complete, unless the person, serving it, tenders
to the person, in whose custody the prisoner may be, if

such person be a sheriff; coroner, constable or marshal
the fees allowed by law for bringing up the party, nor
unless he also give an undertaking to such oflicer, to
the effect that the charges of carryinguback the party.
ifvremanded, shall be paid, and that-he shall not es-

cape by the way, either in going to or returning from
the place to which he is to be taken. But this section

does not apply to a case, where the writ is issued on

the application of the attorney general, or by the dis-
trict attorney.

§1350. The writ of deliverance may be served, by
delivering the same to the person to whom it is direct-
ed, or if he cannot be found, by leaving it at the jail,
or other place, in which the "party is conf1ned,‘wi'th
any under o$cer -or other person of proper age, having
charge for the time, of such party.

§ 1351. If the person, on whom the writ ought to be
served, conceal himself, or refuse admittance to the

person attempting to serve it, it may be served by amxs
ing it, or a copy thereof, in some conspicuous place on
the outside, either of his dwelling house, or of the

place where the party is conhned.

§ 1352. It is the duty of every sheriff, coroner, con-
stable or marshal, upon‘ whom a writ of deliverance has
been served, whether such writ be directed to him or
not,‘ upon payment or tender of the fees allowed by
law, and the delivery or tender of the undertaking herein
prescribed, to obey and return the writ, according to the

exigency thereof; and it is the duty of every other per- —

son, upon whom the writ is served, having the custody
of the person, for whose benefit it is issued, to obey

and return it according to the command thereof,
without requiring any undertaking, or the payment of

any fees, unless the payment of such fees has been re?

quired by the judge issuing the writ.

§ 1353. Every judge, allowing a writ of deliverance ’

directed to a person other than a sheriff, coroner, con-
stable or marshal, may, in his discretion, require in
order to render the service effectual, that the charges of
bringing up party, be paid by the applicant; and in such
case he must, in the allowance of the writ, specify the
amount of such charges, which cannot exceed the fees
allowed by law to sheriffs for similar services.

§ 1354. If the writ be returnable at a certain time,
such return must be made, and the party produced, at

the time and place specified therein; if it be returnable
forthwith, and the place be within twenty miles of the
place of service, the return must be made and the par-

ty produced within twenty-four hours, and the same
time is allowed for every additional twenty miles.

nated, must be shown in the affidavits. 1

upon a day to which it may be adjourned, the judge,
may correct any error that may appear in the state-
ment of the amount due on the mortgage ; and for that
purpose may examine witnesses, or receive other evi-
dence.

If it appear to his satisfaction, by iiic evidence, and
by inspection of the mortgage, or other ‘collateral
contract, that the holder was entitled to foreclose by
reason of default in payment, and that all the proceed-
ings have been in conformity with this chapter, he must

confirm the foreclosure and sale, by an order indorsed
on or attached to, the atlidavits or certificate and to

be filed and recorded therewith in the office of the

county clerk.

sold, stating the surplus, if any, or the deficiency, if
any, remaining due on the mortgage, and unsatisfied

to be served, as provided in section 1386, cannot be
found, and his place of residence is unknown, and

cannot on diligent inquiry be ascertained, and that fact

tached, must be filed and recorded at length in the
ofiice of the clerk of the county, where the land was

title of both the mortgagor and mortgagee to the pur-
chaser, and, as a foreclosure of the equity of redemp-
tion of every person, upon whom the notice was served
as determined in the order ofconiirrnation, whose in-

terest is derived from the mortgagorsubsequent to ‘the
mortgage, or from a lien attached since that time.

§ 1401. Upon the application to confirm the sale, or

at such other time as the judge may then appoint, he
must proceed to determine in a summary manner, the
right of any person entitled to an interest in surplus
money arising on a sale. He must also make such or-
der as may be necessary for the disposition of any
money in the sheriff ’s hands. His orders in the case

may be enforced in the same manner as orders in ac-
tions, and disobedience thereof may be punished in the

same manner.

§ 1402. The order of a judge respecting the payment
or distribution of money arising upon the sale of mort-
gaged property, pursuant to this chapter, is subject to
appeal to the supreme court, in the same manner as an
order refusing a state writ.

§1403. When a part of the money secured by the
mortgage only is due, and part of the property remains
unsold, the mortgage may, for any subsequent default,
be again foreclosed, as to the remainder of such pro-
perty, and a sale thereof made as at first.

-show cause before the justice, at a specified place and

time, why a warrant of possession should not be issued

from his usual place of business, by leaving it with some
person of suitable age and discretion at either; or,

3. If such place of residence and business cannot be
ascertained, or a person of suitable age and discretion

there cannot be found, then by aflixing it, in a conspi-

cuous place, on the property, respecting which the pro-

scribed in section 1426, and must collect the costs in
the same manner, as upon a judgment in a justice’s

court.

3, 1418. Upon the request of either party, the justice
may adjourn the trial, for the purpose of enabling such
party to procure his witnesses, whenever it appears to

be necessary, and due diligence has been already used;

of another not made a defendant: and

3. Deliver to the plaintiff an undertaking, with sure-
ties approved by the justice, to the effect, that he will‘

commit no waste during his occupancy of the proper-
ty, and that if an action be brought by the plaintiff,

thereof, he will pay the costs, and such damages as
may be recovered therein for withholding the poses-

SIOII.

§ 1422. When the application is under the second
subdivision of section 1410, if the unexpired term of the
lease, under which the property is held, exceed one
year at the time of issuing the warrant, and the notice
or order was not personally served upon the tenant, he,
or his successor in interest, or one having a lien upon
the property, may, within sixty days after the execution
of. the warrant, pay or tender to the lessor or his suc-
cessor in interest, or to the justice, the rent in arrear to

or incorporated village of this state, may create a lien
on the building and on the interest of the owner in the
lot of land upon which it stands, for the price or value
of such labor 0' materials, as provided in this chapter.

The claimant must deliver to the clerk a statement
in writing, verified by aflidavit, setting forth briefly the
following particulars:

1. The situation of the building, designating it by
the street on which. it is situated, andthe number of

the lot, if the street be named, and the lot numbered,
or otherwise by some certain or known designation:

2. The owner of the building, under whose authority
the lien was created :

3. The particulars of the claim and the amount
thereof, which amount, if the claim he made beforethe
labor has been performed, or the material supplied, and
the amount payable therefor has become due, must be

the amount payable by the terms of thscontract with
the claimant, or capable of being ascertained therefrom
by computation, if afterwards, the amount actually

due: and, \

\

4.’ A copy of the contract with the claimant, ‘if it be
in writing, and if not in writing, a statement of its sub-

stance.

§ 1434. The clerk must thereupon register the lien.
in a book to be kept by him for that purpose, called the
“ book of liens.” The entries must be arranged alpha-
betically, under the name, of,.t_he. owner, and of the
street, separately. It must contain the name ofthgclaimv =
ant and of the person against whom the claim exiath
the amount of the lien, the time when filed, and. a brief.
description of the property. A copy of the statement

must be served on the owner, by delivering it to him
personally, or by leaving it at his residence with a per-

son,of suitable age and discretion, or by depositing it
in the post oflice, directed to him at his place of resi-
dence. From the time of filing the statement, and ser-

ving the copy, the claimant shall have a lien on the

land and building, for the amount then actually due to
him for work and materials, or which afterwards be-

comes due, pursuant to the contract referred to in the
statement; but such statement must be made and filed,
before the expiration of thirty days after the comple-
tion of the work or the supply of the materials.

§ 1435. The lien may be discharged, as follows:

1. By filing a certificate of the claimant or his suc-
cessor in interest, acknowledged or proved in the same
manner as the satisfaction of a mortgage, stating that
the lien is discharged: or

2. By the deposit with the clerk, of a sum of money

equal to the amount claimed, which money shall there-
upon be held subject to the lien: or

3. By an entry of the clerk, made in the book of liens,

after one year has elapsed since the filing of the claim,
stating that no notice has been given to him of legal
steps to enforce the lien: or

4. By a notice from the owner to the claimant, after
the amount has become payable, requiring him to com-
mence an action, for the enforcement of his lien, and
the lapse of_ thirty days thereafter, without the com-
mencement of such action: or

5. By satisfaction of the lien, upon an action for the
enforcement thereof.

(3 1436. After the registry of a lien, and the perform-

ance of the work, or the supply of the materials, the
claimant or the owner may either serve personally
upon the other, a notice in writing, requiring him to
appear before a justice of the peace of the county, at a
specified time, not less than five days from the time of
service, and submit to an accounting for the amount due

for such labor or materials. At the time mentioned in
the notice, or at such other time as the accounting may
be adjourned to, the parties appearing must each de-
liver to the justice, an account in writing of his claim or
offset, if any, verified by affidavit, and submit to exam-
ination thereupon, under the direction of the justice.
If both parties appear, and there arise a question of
fact, a jury may be demanded by either, and such ques-
tion must be tried by a jury in the same manner, as an
issue joined in an ordinary action in a justice’s court.
In like manner, a contractor, thatis a person who con-
tracts with the owner for labor and materials, and who
employs persons under him to do work, or furnish ma-
terials, may serve on such persons, and receive fiom
them a similar notice with the like effect; and a pay-
ment made by the owner, to a person employed by 8
contractor must be allowed by such contractor, in his
account with the owner, to the extent of any judgment
which may be recovered by such person against such
contractor, pursuant to this section.

§ 1437. Upon the accounting mentioned in the last
section, whether a jury be called or not, Witnesses may
be produced by either party, and judgment must be

rendered upon the amount found by the jury or the
justice ; which judgment has the same effect, is subject

to appeal, and may be enforced in the same manner, as

a judgment in an ordinary action in a justice’s court.

§ 1438. After the performance of the work, orthe
supply of the materials, and the expiration of any cre-
dit stipulated for the payment, the lien mentioned in
this chapter may be enforced, by an action. In such
action, all persons whose liens are registered, as pro-

vided in section 1433, may be made parties, and the
court may, by the judgment, direct a sale of the land

and building for the satisfaction of the liens and costs; i

such sale to be without prejudice to the rights of any
prior incumbrancer, owner or other persons not parties

‘to the action. If several such actions be brought by

different claimants, and be pending at the same time,

_ the court may order them to be consolidated into one.

1443. Vessels may be attached.

1444. Several actions may be consolidated.

1446. Vessels under seizure by United States, exempt.

§ 1439. A debt, amounting to at least fifty dollars,
contracted in this state by the owner, master, agent or
consignee of a vessel, is a lien upon the vessel, her

tackle, apparel and furniture, when contracted for either

of the following purposes:

1. Work done, or materials furnished in this state.
towards the building, repairing, equipping and furnish-
ing thereof:

‘2. Provisions and stores furnished in this state. P10‘

per for the use of the vessel at the time they were far-
nished:

3. Wharfage and keeping the vessel in port, includ-
ing the expense of employing persons to watch her.

This lien has preference over every other lien, exc-6Pt

for mariners’ wages. But it ceases in twelve days after
the vessel leaves the port where the debt was contracted

for another place in this state, and immediately upon
her leaving this state:

4. Damage, occasioned to a vessel by collision with
another, through the negligence or wilful misconduct

§ 1440. The lien mentioned in the last section, may
beenforced by an action; in which the court may or-

der the sale of the vessel and the tackle, apparel ‘and

furniture ‘there'o‘f;’or the tackle, apparel and furniture
alone, and the application of the proceeds for the pur-
pose of satisfying the liens thereon. Upon a judgment
of sale, the sale must be made by the sheriff, and his
bill of sale, made in pursuance thereof, vests in the
purchaser a valid title to the property sold, as against

all the parties to the action.

§ 1441. Every person having an interest in or lien
upon the vessel whose name is-known to the plaintiff,
must be made by name, a party to the action,

either asplaintitf or defendant, and all other persons

having such interest or lien, are to be deemed parties
defendants.

§ ‘I 442. ‘The summons must be directed by name to the
known defendants, and generally to all other persons un-
known having an interest in the vessel or a lien there-
on, and must contain a brief description of the vessel,
stating, if contained in the complaint, its name, the
port to which it belongs, the name of its last comman-

der, and briefly the object of the action. The sum-
mons must be served upon the defendants named there-

in as prescribed in section 628, and upon the unknown
defendants as prescribed in sections 629 and 630.

§1443. In such action, the plaintiff, at the time
of filing the complaint, may have the vessel attached

-as a security for the satisfaction of such liens as shall

thereon be adjudged valid. The mode of proceeding
to obtain such attachment, to execute and discharge it,
is the same as upon the ordinary provisional remedy

.by attachment.

§1444. If several such actions. be brought by
different persons having liens upon the same vessel.

and be pending at the same time, the court may order
them to be consolidated into one.

§ 1445. No proceeding under this chapter can be
had against avessel which shall have been seized by
virtue of process from a court of the United States, hav-
ing admiralty jurisdiction, while such vessel is actually
held under such seizure, nor against a vessel which
shall have been sold by order of such court, except for
debts contracted after the sale. But nothing in ‘bi’
section impairs the validity of any.lien created by tlli8
chapter, the payment of which shall be decreed lJY 3
court of the United States.

diately give notice thereof, with the cause of the dis-
tress, the amount of wharfage due, and" an inventory of

the company of thevessel.

§ 1448. If, at the expiration of five days after the no-
tice, the wharfage due, with the costs of the distress,
be not paid, and the property distrained, be not legally
reclaimed, the ofiicer must summon two disinterested

householders, who shall be sworn by him, fairly to ap-.

praise the property distrained. They must thereupon
make and certify the appraisement.

§1449. The officer must, thereupon, give six days
public notice of the sale of the property distrained, by

affixing it on a conspicuous part of the wharf for which
the wharfage was due, and also in two public placesin

Disobedience of the lawful order or process Of "

judicial oflicer, made in the cases specified in 899m”
228, is also deemed to be a contempt of the aufhontl

of such officer.

§ 1468. Every court of justice, escepta court of con-
ciliation, and every judiciafoflicer, has power to punish

contempts by line or imprisonment, or both. But when
the contempt, is not one of those mentioned in the first
or second subdivisions of the last section, or in the
lirst subdivision of section 228, it must appear that
the right or remedy of a party to an action, or special

proceeding, was defeated or prejudiced thereby, before
the contempt can be punished by imprisonment, or by a

fine exceeding fifty dollars. Contempts of justices’
courts are punishable in the manner provided by sec-

tions 1150, 1151, 1152, 1153, and 1154.

§ 1469. When a contempt is committed in the imme-
diate view and presence of the court or otfcer, it may be
punished summarily, for which an order must be made
reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view,
and presence, adjudging that the person proceeded
against, is thereby guilty of acontempt, and that he be
punished as therein described. Such punishment,
however, cannot exceed that prescribed by section 1478.
Where the contempt is not committed in the immedi-
ate view and presence of the court, an aflidavit must

be presented to the court, or oflicer, of the facts consti-
tuting the contempt.

§ 1470. In cases, other than those mentioned in the

last section, the court or oflicer may either issue a war-
rant of arrest, to bring the person charged to answer,

or without a previous arrest, may, upon notice or upon

an order to show cause, grant a warrant of commit-
-ment. But no warrant of commitment can be issued
without such previous arrest to answer, or upon such
notice or order to show cause.

§ 1471. If the party charged be in the custody of an
oflicer, by virtue of a legal order or process, civil or
criminal, except upon a sentence for felony, an order
may be made for the production of such person by the

ofiicer having him in custody, that he may answer, and
he shall thereupon be produced and held until an order

be made for his dispoml.

§ 1472. Whenever a warrant of arrest is issued, pur-
suant to this chapter, the court or otlicer must direct,

whether the person charged may be let to bail for his
appearance upon the warrant, or detained in custody
without bail, and if he may be hailed, the amount in
which he may be let to bail. The directions given in

this respect, must be specified in the warrant.

§1473. Upon executing the warrant of arrest, the

sheriff must keep the person in actual custody, bring
him before the court or ofiicer, and detain him until an
order be made in the premises, unless the person arrest-

ed entitle himself to be discharged, as provided in the
next section.

§ 1474. When the warrant contains the direction to let
the person arrested to bail, he must be discharged from

the arrest, upon executing and delivering to the ofiicer,

at any n'me before the return day of the warrant, a
written undertaking, with two suthcient sureties, to the
effect that the person arrested will appear on the return
of the warrant, and abide the order of the court or
oflicer thereupon, or pay, as may be directed, the sum ‘
specified in the warrant.

§ 1475. The oflicer must return the warrant of ar-
rest, and the undertaking, if any, received by him fnom
the person arrested, by the return day specihed therein.‘
If he fail to make the return, a, warrant of arrest not.
bailable may be issued against him, specifying therein
the cause of issuing it.

§ 1476. The ofiicer to whom the warrant mentioned‘
in the last section is delivered, must execute it, by ar-
resting the person proceeded against, bringing him per-
sonally before the court or oiiicer, and detaining him
in custody until otherwise ordered.

§1477. When the person arrested has been brought
up, or appeared, the court or ofiicer must proceed to in-

vestigate the charge by examining him and witnesses
for or against him, for which an adjournment may be
had from time to time if necessary.

(51478. Upon the evidence so taken, the court or
omcer must determine, whether the person proceeded
against is guilty of thecontempt charged, and if it be
adjudged that he is guilty of the contempt, a fine
must be imposed upon him, not exceeding two hun-

dred and fifty dollars, or he must be imprisoned not ex-
ceeding six months, or both. But in the discretion of
the court, or officer, (in case of inability to pay the line,
or endure the imprisonment,) he may be relieved in
such manner and upon such terms as may be just.

§ 1479. If an actual loss or injury, to a party in an
action or special proceeding prejudicial to his rights
therein, have been caused by the contempt, the court

or oflicer, in addition to the line or imprisonment im-
posed for the contempt, may order the person proceed-

ed against to pay to the party aggrieved a sum of money

sutiicient to indemnify him, and to satisfy his costsand
expenses, which order, and the acceptance of mane?

under it, is a bar to an action by the aggrieved part)’
for such loss or injury.

§ 1480. When the contempt consists in the omission
to perform an act which is yet in the power of the per-
son to perform, he may be imprisoned, until he shall
have performed it, and in that case the act must be

specified in the warrant of commitment.

§ 1481. .Persons proceeded against, according t0 W’
provisions of this chapter, are also liable to indictment

for the same misconduct, if it be an indictable offence,
but the court before which a conviction is bad 011 ‘he
indictment, in passing sentence, must take into con8id'
eration the punishment before inflicted.

§ 1482. When the warrant of arrest has been return-
ed served, if the person arrested do not appear on the
return day, the court or officer may issue another war-
rant of arrest, or may order the undertaking to be pro-

secuted, or both. If the undertaking be prosecuted, the
measure of damages in the action, is the extent of the

loss or injury sustained by the aggrieved party, by reason
of the misconduct for which the warrant was issued,

and the costs of the proceedings.

§1483. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter,
an ofiicer is required to keep a person arrested in ac-

tual custody, and to bring him before a court or oflicer,
the inability, from illness or otherwise, of the person to

attend is a suflicient excuse for not bringing him up.
Nor can the otiicer be required to confine a person ar-

rested upon the warrant in a prison, or otherwise to re-
strain him of personal liberty, except so far as may be

necessary to secure his personal attendance.

such fact be the amount of damages or otherwise, and

a trial thereof by jury be demanded by either party, such
trial must be ordered.

satisfying the assessments, mentioned in the third sub-
division of section 1484, must be made within three

interested, either personally or by publication thereof,

for three weeks successively, next before the time of
appearance, in a newspaper printed in the county. The

judge may also require its publication in one or more
other newspapers, if he deem it necessary, in order to

give notice to the persons interested.

i § 1508. At the time and place specified, or at another

time and place to which the hearing may be then
adjourned, the court must hear the allegations and

evidence of the applicant, and of any other party inte-

rested. The original application and schedules may be

used on the hearing, adjournments may be had, and
testimony taken, from time to time, in the discretion of

the court, and if it become necessary to take an account,

a reference for that purpose may be ordered.

§ 1509. If the court be satisfied that the corporation

is insolvent, or that for any other reason, the dissolution
thereof will be beneficial to the stockholders, and not

injurious to the public, an order of dissolution may be
made, and a receiver appointed. Such corporation
shall thereby cease to exist, and its property shall be

applied in satisfaction of its debts, and in discharge of
its liabilities, and the residue distributed among the
stockholders, according to their respective interests
therein. No action or special proceeding shall abate by

such dissolution, but the receiver may, on motion, be
substituted therein, for the corporation.

gages of real or personal property of such corporation,

in payment of, or security for, an antecedent debt, or
otherwise, in violation of the injunction are void against
the receiver and the creditors.

§ 1511. The receiver must, by public notice, appoint
a general meeting of all the creditors, and others inte-

rested in the corporation, at a time within three months
after his appointment, when all accounts and demands
for and against the corporation, and all open and sub-
sisting contracts, must be liquidated and classified as

far as practicable. A statement showing the condition

of the funds, and of the affairs generally in the hands
of the receiver, must be then prepared and exhibited by

the receiver. All books and papers in the hands of the

receiver, are also at all times subject to the examina-

tion of the creditors and stockholders.

§ 1512. After such meeting, and within four months
from the time of his appointment, the receiver must
pay all outstanding just claims against the corporation,
to the extent of the funds in his hands, (except such
as he is by law autho'ri'zed to reserVe,) or if the funds
are insuflicient, must make payment and distribution
in equal proportions, according to their priority.

§ I513. If any money remain in the hands of the re-
ceiver, or be received by him, after the first dividend,

he must within a year thereafter, and as much sooner

as the condition of the assets will permit, after giving

due notice thereof, make a second, and, if possible,
final payment to the creditors, and distribution of the
residue to stockholders, or others entitled, of the re-
maining assets in his hands. If after the second dis-
tribution, there still remain any part of the estate
not collected or distributed, a third distribution must be
made in like manner, and so on, as often as may be neces-
sary; but no distribution among the stockholders can be
made within one year after the appointment of the re-

ceiver, nor until after all the known debts are paid and

liabilities discharged, or a sutlicient fund set apart for
that purpose.

§l514. Notice of every distribution must be pub-
lished at least once a week, for three weeks next be-
fore the time appointed therefor, in a newspaper print-
ed in the county, where the principal place of business
of the corporation was situated, and also in the state

paper.

§ 1515. Any person having a just claim, who has not
been included in the list of creditors, or of persons en-

titled to distribution, or has not not had his just share
of the assets at any former distribution, may appear and

establish his claim, before the final dividend, and shall
thereupon be entitled to his full share out of the re-

maining assets, if sufficient remain to make his pay-

ment or distributive share, equal, in proportion to its

amount, to that of other claims of the same class at all
former dividends, and may thereafter receive with oth-
ers his just proportion.

§ 1516. Immediately after all the funds in the hands
of the receiver have been paid out and applied, he must

make a report to the court, containing a full and accu-

rate account of his proceedings; which report must be
filed with the clerk of the court in the county where

the principal place of business of the corporation was
situated. ‘

§151'7. Previous notice, of the time and place of
* filing the account, must be published once a week for

three weeks, in a newspaper printed in the county, and i

also in the state paper, and a copy of such notice must
also be served on every party, who has previously, in
writing, requested notice of the final account. Such
notice must also state, that the account will remain on
file for the examination of all persons interested, for
two weeks from the time of tiling the same, and if no
objection be made to it by the service of notice, in

Writing, on the receiver, within that time, that an order

closing the account and discharging the receiver, will
be entered.

§ 1518. Upon satisfactory proof, produced to the court,

showing that such account has been tiled after due notice ‘

thereof; in the manner fbr the time prescribed in the
last section, and that no objection has been made there-

to, by notice served on the receiver, an order may be

made that the account of the receiver be confirmed,

and he be thereupon discharged.

§1519. An objection taken to such account, must
state generally in what respect it is erroneous or defec-

tive, and the parties objecting are thereupon entitled to .

five days’ notice of the time and place of presenting

the account, with the objection, to the court for decis-
ion.

§ 1520. The judge must proceed to examine the ac-

count and the objection, pursuant to the notice, on the
day specified, or on some other day to which the ex-

amination may be adjourned, and may, when it in-

volves the taking of oral testimony, or the examination
of numerous vouchers, refer the same‘ to a referee, to

hear the parties and their evidence, and if necessary,
restate the account. Upon filing the report of a referee,

on a receiver’s account, an opportunity must be given
to the parties interested to be heard.

§ 1521. The court must make an order, allowing, dis-
allowing or modifying such account, according to the
report of the referee or otherwise, as may be just, and
must direct the proper payment and distribution of
the balance, if any be found in the receiver’s hands
Such order is final as to all parties receiving notice,
pursuant to the provisions of this title.

§ 1522. Every receiver, appointed pursuant to this
title, must close the affairs of the corporation, and ren-
der his final account to the court, by filing the same

ment, or within such further time as the court, an ap-
plication and cause shown, may allow.

§ 1567. Upon receiving the application, the surrogate
must immediately appoint a time and place in the town
or city, where the insane person or drunkard resides,
to investigate the truth of the allegations made in the
application, which time must not be less than eight not
more than sixteen days thereafter.

§1568. The surrogate must also issue a citation to '

the insane person, to appear at the time and place spe-
cified, and show cause, if he have any, against the ap-

plication. Such citation, with a copy of the application,
must be served by the sheriff, at least six days before the

time of appearance, on the insane person or d1-unkatdv
and on some member of the family of such person, 0‘
of the family in which he resides, of suitable age and
discretion, other than the applicant. '

§l569. The surrogate must also issue to the sheriff
an order, directing him to summon a jury of eighteen
persons, to be drawn from a justice’s jury box, Of
the town or city where the trial is to be had, to appeaf
at the time and place appointed for the investigation.
and to determine the truth of the allegations made ll‘
the application.

§ 1570. The jury must be drawn by the sheriff, in the
presence of the justice, and summoned pursuant to the
surrogate’s order, and a return thereof made, at the
time and place specified, stating the time and manner
of summoning each juror.

§ 1571. At the time and place appointed, or at such
other time as the hearing may be‘ adjourned to for
cause shown, the surrogate must attend and draw
and empanel a jury of twelve persons, in the same
manner as a jury is drawn by a justice, for the
trial of civil actions. When the jury is completed, it
must be sworn by the surrogate, to investigate the

truth of the matters stated in the application, and to
hnd a true inquisition thereon, according to the evi-

dence.

§ 1572. The surrogate must preside at the trial, and
decide all questions of law arising therein, and the trial
must be conducted in all respects like a trial in a civil
action, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

§ 1573. Upon such trial, the alleged insane person

or drunkard may appear by counsel, and may produce
witnesses on his part. But whether he appear or not,
the applicant must prove the truth of the allegations
made in his application.)

§ 15 74. The inquisition of the jury must be in writing,

subscribed by at least nine of the jurors, and must de-
clare that there exists no sufficient reason for a com-

mittee, or that the person is in one of the conditions
mentioned in section 345, specifying which of them.
The surrogate must instruct the jury, as to the form of
the inquisition, and it may be found and subscribed in
his presence, but he can take no part in the delibera-
tion of the jury, nor advise them in respect to their de-

cision, except on questions of law.

§ 1575. If the jury find that the person is in one of
the conditions mentioned in section 1563, the surrogate
must immediately appoint a committee for him.
When the application is for a cause other than habit-
ual drunkenness, the jury must state in the inquisition,

whether or not, in their opinion, the disability is likely

to be permanent. If the jury finds that there exists no
sufiicient reason for a ‘committee, the application’ must

be dismissed.

{} 1576. The appointment must be in writing, and
must define the general duties of the committee, as
prescribed in section 1564. It must be recorded in the
surrogate’s oflice, in the book where the appointment
of general guardians is recorded. The committee must
also give public notice of his appointment by adver-
tisement in a newspaper printed and published in the
county.

§ 1577. The committee must be sworn to execute
faithfully the duties of his trust, according to the best

of his ability. He must also give security in the same

manner, and to the same effect as the general guardian
of an infant. The oath and undertaking must be tiled
in the surrogate’s office.

§ 1578. The surrogate must also appoint appraisers ;

and an inventory and’ appraisal of all the personal pro-
perty of the insane person, must be taken, verified and

returned in the same manner and with the same effect,
as in the case of administration of the estate of a de-
ceased person, except that it must contain also a de-
scription of the real property, and a valuation by the
appraisers of the annual income of each parcel thereof.

§ 1579. The powers and responsibilities of a commit-
tee, in the execution of the trust reposed in him as pre-
scribed by section 1564, are in'all respects like those of
a general guardian, in respect to an infant and his
estate, except as in this chapter otherwise provided.

§ 1580. In the payment of debts, the committee must
be governed by the same rules, as those which regulate
the conduct of administrators.

§ 1581. When there is not personal property, sufficient
with the income of the real property, for the payment
of the debts, or for the proper maintenance of the insane

person or drunkard person and his family, the surrogate

may upon’ a proper accounting by the committee, of
the personal, and of the income of the real, property,

order the real property or such part thereof as he may

deem necessary, to be sold or mortgaged to procure the
necessary funds therefor.

§ 1582. When the inquisition does not state, that the
disability is likely to be permanent, the surrogate must,
before ordering a sale, ascertain the probable necessary

expenditure over the annual income, for a period not
exceeding three years in advance, and must limit the

sale or mortgage, to so much of the real property as
can be sold or mortgaged separately, without material
injury to the residue of the property, and as may be
suflicient to raise such sum, and in all cases he must
first ascertain by evidence the present condition of the
person. Further sales or mortgages may be ordered

from time to time, as may be necessary.

§ 1583. The proceedings for a sale or mortgage, must
be conducted in all respects in the same manner, asfor
a sale by administrators, except as herein otherwise
provided; but the proceeds of sales/, instead of being
paid to the surrogate, are to be-placed in‘ the hands of
the committee.

§ 1584. The committee may be required to give new

or additional security, or to render an account, and
may be removed. He is also subject, in all other re-
spects, ‘to the control and direction of the surrogate, in
the same manner as the general guardian of an infant.

. § 1585. The committee has power, under the direction
of a court of competent jurisdiction, to execute a 0011'

veyance of real property, or to do any other act, in the
specific performance of a contract made by the insane

person or drunkard, when he was capable to contract.

§ 1586. The power of a committee ceases, upon‘ the
death of the insane person, and also when the disabili-
ty, in respect to which he was appointed, has been adt

judged by the surrogate to have ceased, or when he has

been removed for any cause as provided in the next
two sections. °

§ 1587. Upon application to the surrogate to remove
a committee or revoke appointment, made upon the
-affidavits of at least two respectable persons, showing
misconduct of the committee, or that the disability, in
respect to which the committee was appointed, has
ceased, a citation must be issued to the committee, to

the person upon whose application he was appointed,

if living within the county, and to the next of kin, if

any, within the county, who are of full age, to show
cause, if they have any, why the appointment of the‘

committee should not be removed or his appointment

revoked. ‘

§ 1588. The citation must be served at least four-
teen days before the time appointed’ for the hearing.

Upon its return duly served, or upon another day to
which the hearing may be adjourned, the surrogate

must bear the evidence offered‘ for and against the ap-
plication. If suflicient cause for the continuance of

the committee be not shown, the surrogate must by an

order declare, that the disability, in respect to which

the committee was appointed, has ceased, that the
powers of the committee are therefore revoked, and

that the party for whom he was appointed is restored
to his original rights. If misconduct of the committee
be established, he must be removed and another ap
pointed in his place.

{} 1589. The fees of the surrogate, on the appoint-
ment of a committee, are the same, as on the proof of a
will, and for his removal, and the proceedings in rela-
tion thereto, the same as for similar services in case of
administrators. Upon a trial before him, the surrogate
may order costs to be paid, either by a party, or out of

the funds or estate, to any other party, not exceeding
the costs allowed for the trial of a civil action. ‘

costs on the appeal is in the discretion of the appellate

court, but when allowed, they must be at the rate al-
lowed on appeals, to the same court, in civil actions.

the costs on admeasurement, which may have been
paid by the other party, may be added to the costs of
the defence in such action; and if the dower be with-
held from her and she fail for two years to bring an ac-
tion for the recovery thereof, she shall be liable in an
action to the other party for the expenses of admeas-
urement paid by him.

162-ll. Sale of infant’s estate when necessary.
1631. Manner of application and service of notice.
1632. Special guardian to be appointed.

1653. Guardian to give security.

1634. What security required.

1635. Court to hear evidence, or may refer.
1636. Order to be made, its contents.

§ 1629. A conveyance by an infant, of real property,
owned or held by him, may be ordered by the supreme

court in an action in either of the following cases:

1. When the property is held in trust for another:

2. When an agreement to convey the property has
been made, and the agreement ought to be specifically
performed by the infant. When so ordered, the con-
veyance is as effectual as if the infant were of full age,
But nothing in this chapter affects a sale of infants’ estate
when made, as provided in special statutes, by an exece
utor or administrator, upon an order of ‘ the surrogatels
court.

§1630. The real property and leasehold estate of an
infant, may be sold or mortgaged under the direction of
the supreme court, or the county court of the county in
a special proceeding, on the application in writing of

the general guardian or some person next of kin of the
infant, for him, in either of the following cases:

1. When the sale or mortgage is necessary for the in-
fant’s support or education:

2. When the interest of the infant will be promoted
by it, by reason of the unproductiveness of the property
or its being exposed to waste or for any other peculiar
circumstances. But such sale or mortgage can in no

case be made contrary to the provisions of the will or

conveyance by which the property was devised orgrant-

ed to the infant. The application must state the grounds
therefor and must be verified as a complaint in an ac-

tion,

§ 1631. A copy of the application must be served by
delivery in the manner required for the service of a
summons to commence an action against an infant,
with a notice stating that the same will be presented
to the court at a specified time and place, and that ap-
plication to appoint a special guardian will then be
made. The service must be at least ten days before
the time of application, and two days in addition for

every fifty miles distance from the residence of the in-
fant to the place specified.

- 4 mac. Upon the day  or some other day to
which the hearing shall be than adjourned, the court

must appoint a suitable person to be special guardian
for the infant in the proceedings to be had thereom;

at two or more such guardians may be appointed.

§ 1633. Before the appointment of the guardianfcan
be effectual, and before any further proceedings cacrqbe
had, security must be given by the guardian, to‘ the in-
fant, to be approvedby the court, and in such sum astha
court may by an order direct, faithfully to perform the
trust reposed in him, and to account for and apply all
moneys received by him under the directions of the

court.

{} 1634. The security must be an undertaking of the
‘guardian, either with one or more sufiicient sureties,
who must justify, in the manner required for bail on
arrest in an action, or with security by mortgage on un-
incumbered real property in the county where the real
property lies, or the infant resides, worth, exclusive of

buildings thereon, double the value of the amount of
security required.

§ 1635. Upon security being given and upon at least
eight days notice to the special guardian, or upon his
‘consent without notice, the court must proceed to hear
the evidence for and against the application, or may or-

der a reference, as in an action, to ascertain and report
the facts.

§ 1636. Upon the hearing, or in case of reference, up-

on the report of the referee, the court must by an order
grant or refuse the application. If granted, the order

may direct either a sale or a mortgage of the whole or
any part of the property, and must contain a descrip-

tion of the same.

§ 1637. Upon a report to the court, verified by the
oath of the guardian, of an agreement for the sale or
mortgage of the property, subject to the approval of
the court, it must confirm or disapprove the same; it
approved, a conveyance must be given by the guardian
under the direction of the court. The report of the
agreement may be made at the time of the hearing or

afterwards.

§ 1638. The court must make such order for the ap-

plication and disposition of the proceeds of the sale or
mortgage, and for the investment of the same or any

part thereof, as it shall deem best for the benefit of the in-
fant, and must require accounts to be rendered periodi-
cally by the guardian or other person entrusted with

the disposition of the proceeds or its income. Such
proceeds shall be deemed real property of the same na-
ture as the property disposed of. I

§ 1639. Where property is subject to dower, and the
person entitled thereto consents in writing to accept a

 sum in place thereof, or the income during life of
a permanent investment of a reasonable sum, the court

may ascertain and direct the.pay='ment-of such. -sum out
of the proceeds of the property, or the investment
thereof and the payment of the income, as may be
deemed reasonable and may be acceptable to the pen-__
son entitled. If no such consent be given the sale
or mortgage must be made subject to the right of dow-
er. Before any sum shall be paid or investment made,

an effectual release of the right of dower must be made.

§ 1640. When there are several infants owning real
estate as tenants in common or joint tenants, they may

all be united in one application, but the security of the
guardian must be to each severally.

§ 1641. The costs and expenses of the proceedings,

not to exceed twenty-five dollars when there is but one
infant, and ten dollars for each additional one embraced
in the same application, may be paid by the order of

the court from the proceeds of the property.

CHAPTER II.

DEPENDS.

Bncrlox 1641. Application to produce person on whose life an estate depends.
1642. Contents of application.

1643. Twenty days’ notice to be given.

1614. Proceedings on the hearing.

1645. Costs may be allowed.

1646. An estate recovered on presumption of death. to be restored after-
wards, if the person be living.

{} 1641. A person entitled to claim real property, or

entitled to a prior estue, or interest therein, may, once
apart, by motion, apply to the supreme court for a
order, that the person, upon whose life such prior eaten
depends, be 

'1_I§[l642. The application must be made upon affida-
vit, showing,
1. The interest of the applicant, in the real property

which is the subject of the application, describing it,
withthe grounds thereof:

‘£52. The belief of the applicant, that the person, upon
whose life the prior estate depends, is dead, and that
his death is concealed by the party, against whom the
application is made.

’ § 1643. The motion must be upon previous notice, of
at least twenty days, and must be made at a special
term, where a motion might be made in an action
triable in the county where the real property is situ-'
ated.

§ 1644. Upon such motion, the court may make an
order, requiring the production and proof of the identity
of the person, upon whose life the estate depends, and,
in default of his production, may require of the party
against whom the application is made, proof of his ex-
istence, with satisfactory reasons for his absence. Such
evidence may be taken in open court, or by reference,
or by commission to another state or county, together
with any other evidence, which may be necessary tb

determine the question of the existence ofeuch person.
Such order must then be made declaring the existence
or death of the person, as may be in the judgment of
the court conformable to the fast. This order is pri-

mary evidence of the facts therein determined.

§ 1645. Costs on such application, and the proceed-
ings founded thereon, not to exceed twenty-iive dollars,
may, in the discretion of the court, be ordered to be
paid, by either party, to the other.

§ 1646. An estate, which shall have been recovered
upon the presumption or proof of the death of a person,

pursuant to this chapter, must be nestored to the party

from whom it was recovered, or to his heirs, or repre-
sentatives, with the issues and profits in the mean-

time, if it be established that such person is living.

§ 1647. Every order imposing a fine, except upon con-
viction for a public offence, must contain a direction
that the delinquent be imprisoned until the fine be paid;
not to exceed one day for every two dollars of the fine.
I{} 1648. The clerk, immediately after the imposition

of a line, must deliver to the sheriff a certified eopyof
the order imposing it, and transmit a copy of the same
to the treasurer of the county. One order may provide

for the collection of all the fines imposed at the same
court.

§ 1649. The sheriff must proceed to collect the f1ne,s
or to imprison the delinquents named in the order, and
within sixty days from the time of receiving the copy
of the order, must pay over to the county treasurer the
fines collected by him, and tile his return in the county
clerlr’s ofiice, showing the manner in which he has ex-
ecuted the order, stating the amount paid to the county
treasurer, if any. Fines imposed by a city court must

be paid into the city treasury.

' § 1650. The sheriff is liable to the county or city for
the amount of every fine speciiied in the order, unless it
appear by his return that the person, on whom the fine
was imposed, has been arrested, or could not be found.
Such liability may be enforced by action in the supreme

court or by motion in the county court. The sheriff is

liable by action for a false return.

§ 1651. When an undertaking or the condition of a
recognisance, in a criminal action, is by any court de-
clared broken, the court in which it is filed, or the
county court of the county where it is filed, may order

the same to be prosecuted. If judgment be given for
the plaintiff in such action, it must be for the penalty

or sum specitiedin the undertaking.

§ 1652. The county court may, except in the cases

specified in the next section, remit wholly or partly
tines imposed or forfeitures declared by any court in the
county, on application and cause shown, and on such
terms as may be deemed just. If the fine or forfeiture re-
mitted shall have been paid, the officer in Whose
hands it may be, must refund the same, or the part
thereof remitted, upon an order of the court to that ef-
fect.

§ 1653. Fines imposed on conviction of a public oil
fence or for actual contempt of a court, or for disobe-
dience to its orders or process, can only be remitted by
the court by which they were imposed, and that on
cause shown, upon notice to the district attorney. An

undertaking entered into in one county, for the appear-
ance of a person in another, can only be remitted or
discharged by the court, in which such person was
bound to appear, or by the county court of that county,
after the time designated for such appearance, and
then only upon notice tothe district attorney and on
cause shown.

§ 1654. Summary judgment upon an undertaking de-
clared forfeited, may be ordered by the court, without
action, on motion of the district attorney, after ten days
previous notice to the adverse party, of the application
(or the forfeiture and for judgment thereon.

GENERAL DEFINITIONS AND DIVISIONS.

sxcnox 1659. Dednition of evidence.

165). Dennition of proof.

1661. Dennition of law of evidence.

1662. The degree of certainty, required to establish facts.
1663. Four kinds of evidence specided.
1664. Several degrees of evidence specined.
1665. Original evidence, dedned.

1675. Corroboratlve evidence denned.

1676. General divisions and arrangement.

Q1659. Judicial evidence is the means, sanctioned
by law, of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the
truth respecting a question of fact.

§ 1660. Proof is the effect of evidence, the establish-
ment of a fact by evidence.

§ 1661. The law of evidence, which is the subject of

this part of the code, is a collection ‘of general rules
established by law,

'1. For declaring what is to be taken as true, without
proof:

§ 1662. The law does not require demonstration,

that is, such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility

of error, produces absolute certainty; because such proof
is rarely possible. Moral certainty only is required, or
that degree of proof, which produces conviction in an
unprejudiced mind.

{} 1663, There are four kinds of evidence :

1. The knowledge of the court:

2. The testimony of witnesses:

3. Writings:

4. Other material objects presented to the senses.

§ 1664. There are several degrees of evidence:

1 Original and secondary:

2. Direct and indirect:

- 3. Primary, partial, satisfactory, indispensible and
conclusive.

{}1665. Original evidence is an original writing or

material object introduced in evidence.

§ 1666. Secondary evidence is a copy of such original
writing or object, or oral evidence thereof.

§ 1667. Direct evidence is that which proves the fact
in dispute, directly, without an inference or presumption,

and which in itself, if true, conclusively establishes
that fact. For example, if the fact in dispute be

an agreement, the evidence of a witness who was pres-
ent and witnessed the making of it, is direct.

§ 1668. Indirect evidence is that, which tends to es-
tablish the fact in dispute by proving another, and
which, though true, does not of itself conclusively es-
tablish that fact, but which affords an inference or pre-

sumption of its existence. For example, a witness proves
an admission of the party to the fact in dispute. This

proves a fact, from which the fact in dispute is inferred.

§ 1669. Primary evidence is that, which suflices for
the proof of a particular fact, until contradicted and
overcome by other evidence. For example, the certi-

ficate of a recording oflicer is primary evidence of a

record; but it may be afterwards rejected upon proof

that there is no such record.

§ 1670. Partial evidence is that, which goes to estab-
lish a detached fact, in a series tending to the fact in
dispute. It may be received, subject to be rejected as
incompetent, unless connected with the fact in dispute,
by proof of other facts. For example, on an issue of
title to real property, evidence of the continued posses-

sion of a remote occupant is partial, for it is of a de-

tached fact, which may or may not be afterwards con-
nected with the fact in dispute.

§ 1671. That evidence is deemed satisfactory, which
ordinarily produces moral certainty, or conviction in an
unprejudiced mind. Such evidence alone will justify
a verdict. Evidence less than this is denominated
slight evidence.

§ 1672. Indispensible evidence is that, without which
a particular fact cannot be proved.

§ 1673. Conclusive or unanswerable evidence is that,
which the law does not permit to be contradicted. For
example, the record ofa court of competent jurisdiction
cannot be contradicted by the parties to it-. I

' §1674. Cumulative evidence is additional evidence
of the same character, to the same point.

§ 1675. Corroborative evidence is additional evidence
of a different character, to the same point.

§1e7a. This part of the code is divided into six

titles:
The first contains the general principles of evidence:

The second relates to the kinds and degrees of evi-
dence and contains the rules by which is determined

what may be received as evidence:
The third title relates to the production of evidence;
L The fourth relates to the effect of evidence:

The fifth relates to the rights and duties of witnesses;

The sixth relates _to evidence in particular cases, and
contains also miscellaneous and general provisions.

TITLE 1.

OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EVIDENCE.

Blzcrrox 1677. One witness sumcient to prove a fact.

1678. Testimony contined to personal knowledge.

1679. Testimony to be in presence of persons afected.

16$). Witness presumed to speak the truth.

1684. Evidence relating to third persons.

1685. Declarations of deceased person, evidence of pedigree.

1686. Declarations of deceased person, evidence against his successor

1688. Contents of writing, how proved. -

1689. An agreement reduced to writing, deemed the whole.

1690. Construction of language, relates to place where used.

1691. Construction of statutes and instruments, general rule.

1692. The intention of the Legislature or parties.
1693. The circumstances to be considered.

1694. Terms to be construed in their general acceptation.
1695. Written words control those printed in a blank form.
1696. Persons skilled may testify to decypher characters.

1697. Of two constructions, which preferred.

1698 A written instrument construed as understood by parties.

1699. Construction in favor of natural right preferred.
1701. Material allegation only to be proved.

1702. Evidence condned to material allegation.

1703. Amrmative only to be proved.

1704. Facts which may be proved on trial.

§ 1677. The direct evidence of one witness, who is
entitled to full credit, is sufficient for proof of any fact,

except usage, perjury and treason.

tr § 1678. A witness can testify of those facts only which
he knows of his own knowledge, that is, which are
derived from his own perceptions; except in those few

express cases, in which his opinions, or inferences or the

declarations of others, are admissable.

§ 1679. A witness can be heard only upon oath or
affirmation; and, upon a trial, he can be heard only, in
the presence, and subject to the examination, of all the

parties, if they choose to attend and examine.

§ 1680. A witness is presumed to speak the truth.
This presumption, however, may be repelled by the

manner in which he testifies, by the character of_ his
testimony, or by evidence oaffecting his character or
motives, or by contradictory evidence; and the jury are

the exclusive judges of his credibility.

{} 1681. The rights of a party cannot be frejudiced
by the declaration, act or omission of another, except

by virtue of a particular relation between them; there-
fore proceedings against one cannot affect another.

§ 1682. Where, however, one derives title to real prop-
erty from another, the declaration, act or omission of the
latter, while holding the title, in relation to the property

is evidence against the former.

§ 1683. Where also the declaration, act or omission,
forms part of a transaction, which is itself the
fact in dispute, or evidence of that fact, such declara-

tion, act or omission, is evidence, as part of the transac-
tion.

§ 1684. And where the question in dispute between
the parties, is the obligation or duty of a third person,
whatever would be evidence for or against such person,

is primary evidence between the parties.

§ 1685. The declaration, act or omission of a mem-
ber of a family, who is deceased, or out of the jurisdic-
tion, is also admissible as evidence of common reputa-
tion, in cases where, on questions of pedigree, such

reputation is admissible.

§ I686. The declaration, act or omission of a deceas-
ed person, having sufficient knowledge of the subject,
against his pecuniary interest, is also admissible as

evidence to that extent, against his successor in interest.

§ 1687. When part of an act, declaration, conversa-
tion or writing, is given in evidence by one party, the
whole, on the same subject, may be inquired into_by the
other; when a letter is read, the answer maybe given;
and when a detached act, declaration, conversation or

writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration,

conversation or writing, which is necessary to make it
understood, may also be‘ given in‘-evidence.

§ 1688. There can be no evidence of the contents of

a writing, other than the. writing itself; except in the
following cases:

1. When the original is in the possession of the party
against whom the evidence is offered, and he with-

holds it under the circumstances mentioned in section
1753: ' ' ' ' ' ‘

2. When the original ‘cannot be produced, by the

party by whom the evidence is offered, in a reasonable
time, with proper diligence, and its absence is not ow-
ingto his neglect or default :,

3. When the original is a record, or other document,
in the custody of a public oflioer:

4. When the original is a record or other document,

of which a certified copy is expressly made evidence by
this code, or some other statute of this state:

5. When the originals consist of numerousaccounts.
or other documents, which cannot be examined in

court, without great loss of time, and the evidence
sought from them, is ‘only the general result of the

J E ’ I '

whole.

In the cases mentioned ' in subdivisions 3 and 4, a‘
copy of the original must be produced; in those. men-
tioned in subdivisions 1 and 2, either a copy ororal
evidence of the contents.

§‘ 1689; When the‘ terms of an agreement have been
reduced to writing by the‘ parties, it is to be considered
as containing all those terms, and therefore there can
be, between the parties and their representatives, or

successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of the
agreement, other than the contents of the writing, ex-

t cépt in the fdllow'in‘g cases:

1; Wihere a mistake or imperfection of the writing is
put in issue by the pleadings:

2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in
dispute. But this section does not exclude other evi-
dence of the circumstances under which the a'gr’eeme'nt
was made, or‘ to which it relates, as defined in section
1693, or to explain an ambiguity, intrinsic or extrin-
sic, or to establish illegality or fraud; The mm, agree-
ment includes deeds and’ wills’, as well as contracts’
between parties.

§1(i90. The language of a" writing‘ is to be interpret-
ed, according to the meaning it bears in the place of its
eiétsution, 1'mléss‘tlie‘pa'rti6s‘ha've’ reference to a differ-
em place‘.

§ 1691. In the construction of a statute or instrument,
the otlice of the judge is simply to ascertain and de-
clare, what is, in terms orin substance, contained there-
in, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit
what has been inserted; and, where t'her‘e‘ are‘ several
provisions or particulars, such a construction is if pos-
sible, to be adopted as will give e'ffe'ét' to all.

§ 1692. In the construction of a statute, the intention
of the legislature, and in the construction of an instru-
ment, the intention of the parties, is to be pursued if
possible; and when a general and particular provision
are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the-former.-'
So a particular intent will control a general one, that‘
is inconsistent with it.

§ 1693. For the proper construction of an instrument,
the circumstances under which it -was made, including-
the situation of the subject of the instrument, and of

the parties to it, may also be shown, so that the judge
be placed in the position of those, whose language he

is to interpret.

§ 1694. The terms of a writing are presumed to have
been used in their primary and general acceptation,
but evidence is nevertheless admissible, that they have

a local, technical or otherwise peculiar signification,

and were so used and understood in the particular in-
stance, in which case the agreement must be construed
‘accordingly.

§ 1695. When an instrument consists partly of writ-
ten words, and partly of a printed form, and the two
are inconsistent, the former controls the latter.

§ 1696. When the characters, in which an instrument
is written, are ditiicult to be decyphered, or the language

of the instrument is not understood by the court, the evi-
dence of persons skilled in decyphering the characters,
or who understand the language, is admissible to

§ 1698. A written notice, as well as every other writ-
ing, is to be construed according to the ordinary accepta-
tion of its terms. Thus a notice to the drawers or en-
dorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory note, that
it has been protested for want of acceptance or pay-
ment, must be held to import, that the same has
been duly presented for acceptance or payment, and
the same refused, and that the holder looks for pay-

ment, to the person to whom the notice is given.

§ 1699. Where a statute or instrument, is equally

susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of natu-
ral right, and the other against it, the former is to be

adopted.

§1701.' None but a material allegation need be
proved. ‘ ' '

§1702. Evidence must correspond with the sub-
stance of the material allegations and be relevant
to the question in dispute. Collateral questions must

therefore be avoided. It is however within the dis-
cretion of the court, to permit inquiry into a col-

lateral fact, when such fact is directly connected with

the-questionin dispute. and is essential to its proper

«determination, or when it affects the credibility of a
"witness.

§«1703. Each party must prove his own affirmative
allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of
a negative allegation, except when such negative alle-
gation is an essential part of t-he statement of the right
or title, on which the cause of action or defence is

‘founded, nor even in such case when the allegation is

a denial of the existence of a document, the custody of

which belongs to the opposite party.

.§ 1704. -In conformity with the preceding provisions,

evidence may be given, upon a trial, of the following

§I7l8. Laws, whether organic or ordinary, are ei-

ther written or unwritten.

§ 1719. A. written law is that which is promulgated
in writing, and: of which a record is in existence.

§1720. The organic law is the constitution of go-
vernment, and is altogether written. Other written
laws are denominated statutes. The written law of
this state is therefore contained in its constitution and

statutes, and in the constitution and statutes of the
United States.

§1721. Statutes are public or private. A private
statute, is one which concerns only certain designated

individuals, and affects’ only their private rights. All
other statutes are public, in which are included, sta-
tutes creating or affecting corporations-

§ 1722. Unwritten law is the law not promulgated
and recorded, as mentioned in section 1719, but which
is nevertheless observed and administered in the courts
of the country. It has no‘ certain repository; but is

collected from the reports of the decisions of the courts

and the treatises of learned merr.

§I723. Books, printed or published, under the au-

thority of a sister state, or foreign country, and pur-
porting to contain the statutes, code, or other written

law, of such state or country, or proved to be common-

ly admitted in the tribunals of’ such state, or country,
as evidence of the written law thereof, are admissible

in this state, as evidence of such law.-

§ 1724. The public seal of the state or country, affix
ed to a copy of a written law, or other public writing, is

also admissible as evidence of such law or writing.

§ 1725. The oral testimony of witnesses skilled there-
in, is admissible as evidence of the unwritten law, of a

- sister state, or foreign country, as are also printed

and published books of reports of decisions of the
courts of such state, or country, or proved- to be com-

monly admitted in such courts.

§ 1726. The recitals in a public statute, are conclusive
evidence of-the facts recited for the purpose of carrying
it into effect, but no further. The recitals in a private
statute, are conclusive evidence between parties who
claim under its provisions, but no farther.

{} 1727. A judical record, is the record or of_fic_i_al en-
try of the proceedings in a court of justice, or of the
,ofHc~_ial act of a judicial officer, in an action or special
proceeding.

§ 1728. A judicial record of this state, or of the Uni-

. ted States, may be proved by the production of the

. original, or by a copy thereof; certified by the clerk, or

other person having the legal custody thereof. That of

a sister state, may be proved by the attestation of the
clerk, and the seal of the court annexed, if there be a

clerk and seal, together with a certificate of the chief
judge, or presiding magistrate, that the attestation is in

due form.

§ 1729. A judicial record of ‘a foreign country, may
be proved by the attestation of the clerk, with the seal

- of the court annexed, if there be a clerk and seal, or

of the legal keeperwof the record with the seal of his
office annexed", if there be a seal, together with a cer-

~ tificate of the chief judge, or presiding magistrate,

that the person making the attestation is the clerk of
the court, or the legal keeper of the record,_and in
either case, that the signature of such person is gen-

‘nine; and also together with the certificate of the sec-

retary of state, or other officer of the government, un-
der whose authority the record is kept, having the cus-

tody of the great or principal seal of such government,
to the effect that the court or oflicer, whose judicial act
is certified, had jurisdiction to perform __such act, speci-
fying generally the nature of the jurisdiction, and veri-
fying the signature‘ of the clerk, or other legal keeper
of the record, and also verifying the signature of the

chief judge, or presiding magistrate.

§ I730. A copy of the judicial record of a foreign
country is also admissible in evidence upon proof;

1. That the copy offered has been compared by the
witness with the original, and is an exact transcript of
the whole of it:

2. That such original was in the custody of the
clerk of the court, or other legal keeper of the same:
and

3. That the copy is duly‘ attested by a seal, which is
proved to be the seal of the court where the record re-
mains, if it be the record of a court, or if there be no
such seal, or if it be not a record of a court, by the

signature of the legal keeper of the original.

§ 1731. The effect of a judgment, or tinal order, in an
action or special proceeding, before a court or judge of
this state, or of the United States, having jurisdiction
to pronounce the judgment or order, is as follows :

t. In case of a judgment, or order, against a specific
thing, or in respect to the probate of a will or the ad-

ministration of the estate of a deceased person, or in

respect to the personal, political or legal condition or
relation ofa particular person, the judgment or order is
conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or ad-

ministration, or the condition or relation of the person:

2. In other cases, the judgment or order is, in respect
to the matter directly adjudged, conclusive between
the parties, and their successors in interest by title
subsequent to the commencement of the action or spe-
cial proceeding, litigating for the same thing, under the

same title, and in the same c zpacity.

§ 1732. Other judicial orders of a court or judge of
this state, or of the United States, create a disputable
presumption according to the matter directly deter-
mined, between the same parties, and their representa-
tives and successors in interest by title subsequent to
the commencement of the action or special proceeding,

litigating for the same thing, under the same title, and
in the same capacity.

§ 1733. The parties are deemed to be the same, when
those, between whom the evidence is offered, were on
opposite sides in the former case, and a judgment, or

other determination, could in that case have been made

between them alone, though other parties were joined
with both or either.

§ 1734. That only is deemed to h-ave been adjudged
in a former judgment, which appears upon its face to
have been so adjudged, or which was actually and ne-
cessarily included therein, or necessary thereto.

§ 1735. Whenever, pursuant to the last four sections,
a party is bound by a record, and such party stands in

the relation of a surety for another, the latter is also
bound, from the time that he has notice of the action
or proceeding, and an opportunity, ..at the surety’s re-
quest, to join in the defence.

§ 1736. The effect of a judicial record ofa sister state,
is the same in this state as in the state where it was
made, except that it can only be enforced here by an

action or special proceeding, and except also, that the
authority of a guardian or committee, or of an executor
or administrator, does not extend beyond the jurisdiction

of the government, under which he was invested with

his authority.

§ 1737. The effect of the judicial record of a court of

admiralty of’ a foreign country, is the same as if it were
the record of a court of admiralty of the United States.

§ 1738. The effect of the judgment of‘ any other tri-
bunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to pro-.
nounce the judgment, is as follows:

1. In case of a judgment against a specific thing, the
judgment is conclusive, upon the title to the thing:

2. ln case of a judgment against a person, the judg-
ment is presumptive evidence of a right, as between

the parties, and their successors in interest by a subse-
quent title, and can only be repelled by evidence of 1
Want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collu-
sion, fraud or clear mistake of law or fact.

§1739. Any judicial record may be impeached, by
evidence of a want of jurisdiction inthe court or judi-
cial officer, of coll Ltsion‘ between the parties, or of fraud
in the party offering the‘ record, in respect to the pro-
ceedings. /

§ 1740. The jurisdiction suflicient to sustain a record,
is jurisdiction over the cause, over the parties, and over
the thing when a specific thing is the subject of the
judgment.

§ 1741. Other official documents may be proved as

follows :

1. Acts of the executive of this state, by the records
of the state department of the state, and of the United

or the jury, with writings, admitted or treated as genuine

by the party against whom the evidence is offered.

old, the comparison may be made with writings, pur-
porting to be genuine, and generally respected and act-
ed upon as such, by persons having an interest in know-
ing the fact.

the person whose act is in question, the course of busi-
ness, or the course of nature.

judgment ‘or‘ order lmay be used ‘as e\'ridence’:'

8. Any other presumption, which by statute, is ex-
pressly made conclusive.

1‘

§ 1783. A last will and testament, except when made
by _a soldier in actual military service, or by a marine!
at sea, is invalid, unless it be in writing, and executed
with such formalities as are required by law. Evi-
dence, therefore, of such will cannot be received.
without the written instrument itself, or secondary
evidence of its contents, in the cases prescribed by
law.

§ 1784. A written will cannot be revoked or altered,
otherwise than by another written will, or another
writing of the testator, declaring such revocation or

or by his lawful agent, under written authority, and ex-
ecuted with such formalities as are required by law. .

§ 1786. The preceding section must not be construed
to affect the power of a testator, in the disposition of
his real property by a last will and testament; nor to
prevent a trust from arising or being extinguished by
implication or operation of law, nor to abridge the pow-

-er ‘of any court, to compel the specific performance of

sale, the price, and the names of the purchaser and
person on whose account the sale is made, is a sufficient
memorandum:

5. An agreement for the leasing, for a longer period
than one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an
interest therein. An agreement relating to real proper-

ty, made by an agent of the party sought to be charged,
is invalid unless the authority of the agent be in writ-
ing, subscribed by the party.

§ 1790. No evidence is admissible to charge a person

upon a representation, as to the credit of a third person,

unless such representation, or some memorandum
thereof, be in writing, and either subscribed by, or -in

§ 1795. The process by which the attendance of a
witness is required, is a subpoena. It is a writ or order
directed to a person, and requiring his attendance, at a
particular time and place, to testify as a witness. It
may also require him to bring with him any books,

documents, or other things under his control, which he

is bound by law to produce in evidence.

§ 1796. The subpaana is issued as follows:

.1. To require attendance before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, it is issued in the name of the
court, before which the attendance is required, or in
which the issue is pending:

2. To require attendance out of court, in an action
or special proceeding pending in court, it is issued in
the name of the court, in which the action or proceed-

ing is pending:

3. To require attendance out of court before a judge,
justice, or other otiicer, authorized to administer oaths

in a special proceeding, under the authority of this
state, and pending in court, it is issued by the judge,
justice, or other otiicer, before whom the attendance is
required:

4. To require attendance before a commissioner, ap-
pointed to take testimony, by a court of any_ other
state, or country, or before a judge, justice or other per-
son, in any other case allowed by law, it may be issued
by a judge of the supreme court, or by a county judge
or jnctice of the peace, in places within their respective
jurisdictions. ‘

§ 1797. Any party or attorney of a party, in an action,
or special proceeding pending in court, may at any
time, ‘issue in the name and on behalf of the court, as
many subpoenas for witnesses within the state, pursuant
to subdivisions 1 and 2 of the last section, as may be
required by such party. Every judge, justice, or other
oflicer, authorized by subdivisions 3 and 4 of the last
section to issue subpoenas, may on the application of

any party, and such proof, _ as this code requires in the
particular case, issue subpoenas signed by such judge,

justice, or other officer, with his name of otlice for such

witnesses, as the party reasonably requires.

§ 1798. The service of a subpoena is made, by show-
ingitbe original, and delivering a chpy or a ticket, con-
taining its substance, to the witness personally, giving
or offering to him at the same time, the fees, to which

he is entitled, for travel to and from the place desig-
nated, and one day’s attendance there. Such service
must be made, so as to allow the witness a reasonable

time, for preparation and travel to the place of atten-
dance.

§ 1799. If a witness be concealed in a building or
vessel, so as to prevent the service of a subpoena, upon
him, the court or officer issuing the subpoena, may,
upon proof by affidavit, of the concealment, and of the
materiality of the witness, make an order, that the
sheriff of the county serve the subpaana, and the sheriff
must serve it accordingly, and for that purpose may
break into the building or vessel, where the witness is
concealed.

§ 1800. A witness is not obliged to attend fbr exami-

nation upon a deposition, or for cross-examination upon
an aflidavit, in any other county than that of his resi-

dence, or where he is served with the subpoena; nor is

a witness obliged to attend for oral examination, before
a court or judge out of the county where the witness
resides, or is served with the subpoena ; except that in
case of an action or special proceeding pending in
court, a judge thereof, or a judge of the supreme court,
or a county judge, . upon an affidavit of a party, or his
attorney, shewing that the testimony of the witness is

material and his attendance necessary, may endorse on '

the subpaana an order for the attendance of the wit-
ness; in which case, the service of such subpoena and

order, and the payment of double fees to the witness,
are sufficient to require his attendance, in the same

manner as if he resided in the county.

'§ 1801. A person present in court, or before a judicial

oiiicer, may be required to testify, in the same manner,
as if he were in attendance upon a subpoena, issued by
such court or otiicer.

. § 1802. Disobedience to a subpcena, ora refusal to be
sworn or to answer as a witness, or to ‘subscribe an af-

fidavit or deposition when required, may be punished
as a contempt, by the court or oiiicer issuing the sub-
pcena, or requiring the witness to be sworn ; and if the

witness be a party, his complaint, answer or reply may

be stricken out.

§ 1803. A witness disobeying a subpcena shall also

forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of fifty dollars,
and all damages which he may sustain, by the failure
of the witness to attend; which forfeiture and damages

may be recovered in a civil action.

{} 1804. In case of the failure of a witness to attend,
the court, or officer issuing the subpaana, upon proof of
the service thereof, and of the failure of the witness,
may issue a warrant to the sheriff of the county, to ar-
rest the witness, and bring him before the court or oHi-
cer where his attendance was required.

§v1805. Every warrant of commitment, issued by a
court or oiiicer, pursuant to this chapter, must specify
therein particularly the cause of the commitment, and
if it be for refusing to answer a question, such question

must be stated in the warrant. And every warrant to

arrest, or commit a witness, pursuant to this chapter,
must be directed to the sheriff of the county, where

the witness may be, and must be executed by him in

the same manner as process issued by the supreme
court.

§1806. If the witness be a prisoner, confined in a
prison within" this state, an order for his examination
in the prison upon deposition, or for his temporary re-
moval and production, before a court or officer, for the
purpose of being orally examined, may be made, as

follows :

1. By the court itself, in which the action or special
proceeding is pending unless it be a justice’s court:

2. By a judge of the supreme court, or county judge
of the county, where ‘the action or proceeding is pend-
ing, if pending in a justice’s court, or before a judge,
or other person out of court.

§ 1807. Such order can only be made on the motion
of a party, upon afiidavits, showing the nature of the
action or proceeding the testimony expected from the

witness, and its materiality.

§ 1808. It the witness be imprisoned in the county
where the action or proceeding is pending, and for a
cause other than a sentence for felony, his production

may be required. In all other cases, his examination
must be taken upon deposition.

beginning the case, must exhaust his evidence before
the other party begins.

' § 1838. If either party require it, the judge may ex-
clude from the court room any witness of the adverse

party not at the time under examination, so that he
may not hear the testimony of other witnesses.

§ 1839. When a witness does not understand and
speak the English language, an interpreter must be

sworn to interpret for him.

I; 1840. The court may exercise a reasonable control
over the mode of interrogation, so as to make it as rapid,
as distinct, as little annoying to the witness, and as
effective for the extraction of the truth, as may be, but
subject to this rule, the parties may put such legal and
pertinent questions as they see fit. The court, how-

ever, may stop the production of further evidence,
upon any particular point, when the evidence upon it
is already so full as to preclude reasonable doubt.

§ 1841. The examination of a witness by the party
producing him, is denominated the direct examination;

the examination of the same witness, upon the same
matter, by the adverse party, the cross-examination.
The direct examination must be completed before the
‘cross-examination begins, unless the court otherwise
direct.

t 1342. A question, which suggests to the witness the
answer which the examining party desires, is denomi-
nated a leading -or suggestive question. -On a direct
examination, leading questions are not allowed, except
in the sound discretion of the court, under special cir-
cumstances, making it appear that the interests of jun-
tice require it.

§ 1843. A witness is allowed to refresh his memory,
respecting a fact, by anything written «by hJ'mse}£ or
under his direction, at the time when the fact -oecureil
or immediately thereafter, or at any other time when
the fact was fresh in his memory, and he knew that the
same was correctly stated in the Writing. But in such
case the writing must be produced, and may be seen
by the adverse party, who may, if he choose, cross-
examine the witness upon it, and may read it to the
jury. So also a witness may testify from such a writ-

ing, though he retain no recollection of the particular
facts ; but such evidence must be received with cau-
tion.

§ 1844. The opposite party may cross-examine the
witness, as to any facts stated in his direct examination.

or connected therewith, and in so doing, may put lead-
ing questions, but if he examine him, as to other mat-

ters, such examination is to be subject to the same
rules as a direct examination.

1 § 1845. The party producing a witness, is not allow-,
ed to impeach his credit by evidence of bad character,
but he may contradict him by other evidence, and may
also show that he has made at other times, statements

inconsistent with his present testimony, as provided
in section 1848.

§ 1846. A witness once examined,.cannot be re-ex-

amined as to the same matter, without leave of the

court, But he may be re-examined as to any new

matter, upon which he has been examined by the ad-

verse party. And after the examinations on both sides
are once concluded, the witness cannot be recalled
without leave of the court. Leave is granted or with-

held, in the exercise of a sound discretion.

§ 1847. A witness may be impeached by the party
against whom he was called, by contradictory evidence,

or by evidence that his general reputation for truth is

bad, or that his moral character is such as to render
him unworthy of belief, but not by evidence of particu-
lar Wrongful acts; except that it may be shown by the

examination of the witness, or the record of the judg-

ment, that he has been convicted of a felony.

§ 1848. A witness may also be impeached, by evi-

dence that he has made, at other times, statements in-
consistent with his present testimony; but before this
can be done, the statements must be related to him,

with the circumstances of times, places and persons
present; and he must be asked whether he has made

such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them.
If the statements be in writing, they must be shown to
the witness, before any question is put to him concern-

ing them.

6; 1849. Evidence of the good character of a party, is
not admissible in a civil action, not of a witness in any
action, until the character of such partyor witness has

been impeached, or unless the issue involve his charac-
ter.

§ 1850. Whenever a writing is shown to a witness it
may be inspected by the opposite party, and if proved
by the witness, must be read to the jury before his
testimony is closed, or it cannot be”read, except on re-
calling thegwitness.

§1851 The judge himself, or any juror, may be

called as a witness by either party; but in such case
it is in the discretion of? the court or judge, to order the
trial to be postponed or suspended, and to take place

before another judge or jury.

TITLE IV.

01-‘ THE EFFECT OF EVIDENCE.

§ 1852. The jury, subject to the control of the court,

in the cases specified in this code, are the judges of the
effect or value of evidence addressed to them, except
when it is hereby declared to be conclusive. They

are however to be instructed by the court, on all proper
occasions;
I. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence

is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal discre-

tion, and in subordination to the _rules of evidence;

2. That they are not bound to decide in conformity
with the declarations of any number of witnesses,
which do not produce conviction in their minds, against
a less number, or against a presumption or other evi-
dence satisfying their minds;

3. That a witness, false in one part of his testimony,
is to be distrusted in others;

0

4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be
viewed with distrust, and the oral admissions of a

party with caution:

I

5. That in civil cases the affirmative oi‘ the issue
must be proved, and when the evidence is contradicto-

ry, the decision must be made accordingto the prepon-
derance of evidence-; that in criminal cases, guilt must

be established beyond reasonable doubt;

6. That evidence is to be estimated, not only by its

own intrinsic weight, but also according to the evi-
dence which it is in the power of one side to produce,

and of the other to contradict, and therefore,

7. That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is
offered, when it appears that stronger and more satis-
factory was within the power of the party, the evidence
offered should‘ be viewed with distrust

TITLE V.

01-‘ THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF WITNE$ES.

Itcnou 1853. Witnesses bound to attend when subpoenaed.
1854. Witnesses bound to answer questions.

1855. Right of witnesses to protection.
1866. Witnesses protected from arrest when attending or going or return-
ing.
1857. To make atlldavit if arrested.
1858. Court to discharge witness from arrest.

§ 1853. It is the duty of a witness, duly served with
a subpoena, to attend at the time appointed, with any

papers under his control required by the subpaana, to
answer all pertinent and legal questions, and, unless

sooner discharged, to remain till the testimony is closed.

§ 1854. A witness must answer questions legal and
pertinent to the matter in issue, though hisanswer may
establish a claim against himself. But he need not
give an answer, which will have a tendency to subject
him to punishment for a felony. Nor need he give an
answer, which will have a direct tendency to degrade
his character, unless it be to the very fact in issue, or
to a fact from which the fact in issue would be pre-
sumed. But a witness must answer as to the Fact of
his previous conviction for felony.

§ 1855. It is the right of a witness to be protected
from irrelevant, insulting or improper questions, and from
harsh or insulting demeanor ; to be detained only so long
as the interests of justice require it ; to be examined only

as to matters legal and pertinent to the issue.

§ 1856. Every person who has been in good faith, served
with a subpoena, to attend as a witness before a court,

judge, commissioner, referee, or other person, in a case
where the disobedience of the witness may be punish-

ed as a contempt, is exonerated from arrest, in a civil

action, while going to the place of attendance, neces-
sarily remaining there, and returning therefrom.

The arrest of a witness contrary to this section is

void, and when wilfully made, is a contempt of the
court; and the person making it, is responsible to the

witness arrested, for double the amount of the damages
which may be assessed against him, and is also liable
to an action at the suit of the party serving the
witness with the subpcena, for the damages sustained
by him in consequence of the arrest.

§ 1857. But an officer is not so liable, unless the
person claiming exemption make, if required, an affida-

davit, stating :

1. That he has been served with a subpoena, to attend
as a witness before a court, oflicer, or other person, spe-
cifying the same, the place of attendance, and the
action or proceeding in which the subpoena was issued,
and:

2. That he has not been thus served by his own pro-
curement, with the intention of avoiding an arrest.

The affidavit may be taken by the officer, and ex-
onerates him from liability for not making the ar-

rest or for discharging the witness when arrested.

§ 1858. The court or oilicer issuing the subpcena, and
the court or oflicer before whom the attendance is re-
quired, may discharge the witness from an arrest made
in violation of section 1856. If the court have ad-
journed before the arrest, or before application for the
discharge, a judge of the court, or a county judge, may

grant the discharge.

at the time specify any objection he may have to the _

money, instrument or property, or he must be deemed
to have waived it, and if the objection be to the amount

or kind of property, he must specify the amount, terms
or kind which he requires, or be precluded from object-

ing afterwards.

§ 1862. The following are the rules, for construing
the descriptive part of a conveyance of real property,

when the construction is doubtful, and there are no

other suflicient circumstances to determine it:

1. Where there are certain definite and ascertained

particulars in the description, the addition of others,
which are indefinite, unknown or false, does not frus-

trate the conveyance, but it is to be construed by the

first mentioned particulars:

2. When permanent and visible, or ascertained boun-
daries or monuments, are inconsistent with the meas-
urement, either of lines, angles or surfaces, the bounds-

ries or monuments are paramount:

sistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to
that of surfaces, and that of lines, paramount to both:

4. When a road, or a'stream of’ water not navigable,
is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle
of the road, or the thread of the stream, are included in

5. When tide water is the boundary, the rights of the
grantor to low water mark are included in the convey-

ance 2

6. When the description refers to a map, and that

reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it con-
trols them, if it appear, that the parties acted with re-
ti:rence to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate
to other definite, and ascertained particulars.

§ 1863. An offer of compromise is not an admission,
that any thing is due; but admissions of particular
facts, made in a negotiation for a compromise, may be
proved, unless otherwise specially agreed at the time.

{} 1864. In an action for divorce, on the ground of

adultery, a confession of adultery, whether in or out of
the pleadings, is not of itself sufiicient to justify a judg-
