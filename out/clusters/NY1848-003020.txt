294. The trial by a Master, or by referees, shall be conri.vii-wl rep° . ducted
in the same manner and on similar notice as a trial by the \m. Xx viTl. Court.
Every referee appointed pursuant to this Code of Proriw; ib8o, xx., cedure shall
have power to administer oaths in any proceedings before him, and shall have,
generally, the powers vested in a referee by law. Masters and referees shall
have the same power to grant adjournments, and to allow amendments to any plead
ings and to the summons, as the Court, upon such trial, upon the same terms
and with the like effect. They shall have the same power to preserve order and
punish all violations thereof upon such trial, and to compel the attendance
of witnesses be fore them by attachment, and to punish them as for contempt
for non-attendance or refusal to be sworn or testify, as is possessed by the
Court. They must state the facts found, and the conclusions of law, separately ;
and their decision must be given, and may be excepted to and reviewed in like
manner, and with like effect, in all respects, as in cases of appeal under
Section 290 ; and they may in like manner settle a case or exceptions. When
the reference is to report the facts, the report shall have the effect of a
special verdict. Masters and referees to whom causes may be referred, whether
to hear and decide the whole issues or to report upon any spe cific question
of fact, or upon the facts generally, shall hear and decide any objection which
may be made to the competency, relevancy or admissibility of any testimony
which may be offered ; and if, upon hearing such testimony, he shall decide
the same inadmissible, he shall take it subject to such objection, but shall
not incorporate it with the rest of the testimony in the body of his report,
but shall append it separately at the end thereof ; and at the request of any
party to a cause who may tender the necessary expenses incident thereto, the
Master or referee may employ a competent stenographer to take testimony in
such cause ; but such expenses shall not be taxed in the costs or included in
the disbursements thereof. Whenever any cause shall be referred to a Master
or referee and testimony be taken therein, it shall be his duty to reduce the
testimony of the witnesses to writing, and require the same to be read over
and signed by the witness ; but this shall not be con strued to prevent the
use of stenographers for the purpose of taking testimony at such references,
or to require that the testi mony so taken by such stenographers shall be read
over to or signed by such witnesses. When the case shall have been heard and
decided upon the report of the Master or referee and exceptions, the decision
may be reviewed on appeal to the Supreme Court. Referee has power to allow
amendments.—Mason v. Johnson, 13 S. C, 20. This Section does not authorize
a Master to require a party to produce a deed.— Cartee v. Spence, 24 S. C,
550. It is not mandatory, but directory merely, as to the statement "of facts
found and conclusions of law," separately. —Bollman v. Bollman, 6 S. C, 29.
The "facts found" are the conclusions of facts drawn from the testimony. There
should first be a clear statement of all material facts, and then should follow
the conclusions of the referee.—Moore v. Johnson, 7 S. C, 803. An exception to
the report cannot by its own statement supply such defect of facts.— Thompson
v. Thompson, 6 S. C, 279. Nor can the Judge hearing the case upon the report
call for a paper to be produced which was not before the referee.— Griffin
v. Griffin, 20 S. C, 486. It is the duty of the Judge to determine by his own
judgment all the issues in an equity cause ; and the report of the referee
merely aids the Judge in reaching his judgment.— Thorpe v. Thorpe, 12 S. C, 154.
While the report of the referee upon an issue of fact " shall have the effect
of a special verdict," as such a verdict it may be set aside, for any cause for
which verdicts may be set aside.— Fields v. Hurst, 20 S. C, 282. But in equity
his findings of fact are only to assist the Court and for its information, and
may be disregarded by the Court.—lb. When there is a consent order of reference,
of all issues, in a law case, the Judge has power to review the findings of
fact as well as of law, made by the referee, when the report, the testimony
and exceptions are all before him.— Meetze v. R. R., 23 S. C, 1 ; Griffith v.
R. R., 23 S. C, 25 ; Calvert v. Nickles, 26 S. C, 305. A party can be heard
in opposition to the confirmation of the report of the referee, without having
excepted thereto, when he has not been served with a copy or notice thereof ten
days before Court.—Ex Parte Fort, 36 S. C, 20. Referees, how
