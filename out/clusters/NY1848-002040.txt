to the proper determination of the causes of action therein mentioned. Judgement
upon overruling demurrer.—The opposing party is entitled to judgment on the
overruling of a demurrer, unless the judge, in his discre tion, grant leave to
the party to plead over. Ransom v. McClees, 64-17; Merwin v. Ballard, 65-168;
Love v. Com'rs, 64-706; Walsh v. Hall, 66-233 ; Wilson v. Moore, 72-558. Since
act 1871-2, ch. 173, amending this section. —Since the act of i87i-'2, amending
this section, the defendant has a right to answer over on the overruling of
the demurrer. Moore v. Hobbs, 77-65. The defendant has the right to put in an
answer after the overruling of a demurrer, if it appears that the demurrer was
interposed in good faith. Bronson v. Insurance Co., 85-411. Where a demurrer
was overruled in the court below with leave to the defendant to answer over, and
to plaintifff to amend complaint, although the demurrer is sustained on appeal,
yet no final judgment will be entered in the case, but it will be remanded
for further proceeding in the court below, under the leave granted. Morris v.
Gentry, 89-248. If demurrer is frivolous. —But when the demurrer is frivolous,
the mat ter is entirely in the discretion of the court. Dunn v. Barnes, 73-273 ;
Cowan v. Baird, 77-201. Demurrer sustained.—Where a demurrer for want of parties
is sustained, an amendment making the additional parties is proper. Reynolds v.
Smathers, 87-24; or, for other defect, Johnson v. Finch, 93-205. Demurrer that
plaintifff cannot maintain action. —-Where a demurrer that the plaintifff is not
the proper party to bring the action is sustained, the action must be dismissed.
Jones v. McKinnon, 87-294. Court may order action divided. —Under this section
an action containing a cause of action founded on tort and one founded on
contract, can, on motion, be divided in the superior court, but not in the
supreme court. Doughty v. Railroad Co., 78-22. Where two causes of action are
improperly joined, the court may order the action to be divided. Street v. Tuck,
84-605 ; Finch v. Baskerville, S5-205 ; Hodges v. Railroad, 105-170. But not
when there is misjoinder of parties.—The provision of this section, authorizing
the court to direct a division of improperly joined causes of action, does not
extend to the cases where there is also a misjoinder of parties to the action.
Mitchell v. Mitchell, 96-14. May be divided in the discretion of the court. —
Where several defendants are sued as trespassing on land, the court, in its
discretion, may order the action divided. It is not a right that parties can
claim. Bryan v. Spivey, 106-95. Where the causes of action cannot be divided. —
Where the several sup posed causes of action cannot be divided and separately
pursued, the complaint cannot be obnoxious for duplicity England v. Garner,
86-366. Demurrer sustained, plaintifff should pay costs. —When a demurrer of
the defendant is sustained, the plaintifff should pay the costs, and then it
is in the discretian of the court if they shall be allowed to amend. Netherton
v. Candler, 78-88. See Bronson v. Ins. Co., 85-411, cited above. Affidavit in
attachment amended. —The court can allow the amendment of an affidavit upon
which a warrant of attachment is issued, although the former affidavit is wholly
insufficint. Brown v. Hawkins, 65-645. Defective statement of a cause of action.
—There is a wide difference between a defective statement of a cause of action
and a statement of a defective cause of action. If, at any time, it may appear
that the court has no jurisdiction, or the plaintifff no cause of action, the
court may stop the proceedings and dismiss the action. If, however, there is
merely a defective statement of a cause of action, this cannot be done. Garrett
v. Trotter, 65-430. Amendment after verdict. —Where a complaint fails to allege
the assign ment of the notes sued on, an amendment to that effect will be
allowed after verdict. Pearce v. Mason, 78-37. The superior and criminal courts
have power to amend any warrant, process, pleading or proceeding begun before a
justice of the peace, even after verdict and judgment ; but where such amendment
is made after verdict, it should be in conformity with evidence elicited on the
trial. The Code, §908; State v. Baker, 106-758. Amendment to show jurisdiction.
—While consent may not give jurisdic tion generally, when a complaint does not
show jurisdiction as to par ties and subject-matter, the parties can consent to
an amendment whereby such jurisdiction does appear. It seems that the court has
power to allow such amendment without consent of defendant. Planing Mills v.
McNiuch, 99-517. Causes of action arising prior to C. C. P. —This section has
no application to actions brought upon causes of action arising prior to the
adoptiou of The Code. Matthews v. Copeland, 80-30. Note. —The exemptions from
the C. C. P. system seem repealed by The Code of 1883 in every instance except
as regards the statute of limita tions.

such pleading, unless it be made to appear to the Court that it was done for
the purpose of delay, and the plaintifff or defendant will thereby lose the
benefit of a circuit or term for which the cause is or may be docketed ; and if
it appear to the Court that such amendment was made for such purpose, the same
may be stricken out and such terms im posed as to the Court may seem just. In
such case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the adverse party.
After the decision of a demurrer the Court shall, unless it appear that the
demurrer was interposed in bad faith, or for purposes of delay, allow the party
to plead over upon such terms as may be just. If the demurrer be allowed for
the cause mentioned in the fifth subdivision of Section 165, the Court may,
in its discre tion, and upon such terms as may be just, order the action to be
divided into as many actions as may be necessary to the proper determination of
the causes of action therein mentioned. The allowance of voluntary amendment,
it seems, does not allow a wholly different cause of action to be substituted
in place of original one. —Sullivan v. Sullivan, 24 S. C, 474. Facts occurring
since commencement of action cannot be alleged as amend ments in the original
complaint ; they can only be brought before the Court by supplemental complaint.
— McCaslan v. Latimer, 17 S. C, 123. Permission to answer over cannot be claimed
as a right ; it rests in the dis cretion of the Judge, and he may grant such
relief upon payment of costs.— R. R. Co. v. White, 14 S. C, 51 ; Lowry v.
Jackson, 27 S. C, 318. Or without payment of costs.—Stallings v. Barrett, 26
S. C, 474. When Judge properly overruled demurrer made for several causes, and
re quired defendant to answer over by a given time, he acted within authority
herein conferred.— Cureton v. Stokes, 20 S. C, 532. When demurrer is taken in
good faith, the Court in overruling it should allow defendant to answer.— The
New Co. v. Wray, 28 S. C, 86. Amendments

81. Any pleading may be once amended by the party, of course, without costs,
and wi.thout prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time within
twenty days after it is served, or at any time before the period for answering
it expires, or it can be so amended at any time, within twenty days after the
service of the answer or demurrer to such pleading, unless it be made to appear
to the court that it was done for the purpose of delaying, and the plaintifff
or defendant will thereby lose the benefit of a term for which the cause is
or may be placed on the jury trial docket, and if it appears to the court that
such amendment was made for such purpose, the same may be stricken out, and
such terms imposed as to the court may seem just. In all cases a copy of the
amended pleading must be served on the adverse party. After the decision of a
demurrer the court shall allow the party to plead over upon such terms as may be
just. If the demurrer be allowed for the reason that causes of action have been
improperly united, the court may i11 its discretion, and upon such terms as may
be just, order the action to be divided into as many actions as may be necessary
to the proper determination of the causes of action therein mentioned.
