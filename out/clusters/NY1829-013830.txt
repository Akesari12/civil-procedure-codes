account where each party keeps a running account of debits and credits, or
where one, with the knowledge of the other, keeps it. Mauney v. Coit, 86-463.

Mere disconnected and opposing demands are not sufficient. The statute of
limitations begins to run from the date of the last item of the account. Stokes
v. Taylor, 104-394. Running account—not mutual. —Where there is a running
account, all on one side, the statute of limitations begins to run on each item
from its date. Robertson v. Pickrell, 77-302.
