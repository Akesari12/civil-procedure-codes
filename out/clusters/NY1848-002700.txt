consisting of the breach of an express or implied contract to pay, absolutely
or upon a contingency, a sum or sums of money fixed by the terms of the con
tract, or capable of being ascertained therefrom by compu tation. Upon proof of
personal service of summons, or of service of summons by publication, on one or
more of the defendants, and upon the complaint being verified, judg ment shall
be entered at the return term for the amount mentioned in the complaint, against
the defendant or defendants, or against one or more of several defendants,
in the cases provided in section two hundred and twentytwo. (2) Where the
defendant, by his answer in such action, shall not deny the plaintifff's claim,
but shall set up a coun terclaim amounting to less than the plaintifff's claim,
judg ment may be had by the plaintifff for the excess of said claim over the
said counterclaim, in like manner in any such action, upon the plaintifff's
filing with the court a statement admittiug such counterclaim, which statement
shall be annexed to and be a part of the judgment-roll. (3) In actions where the
service of the summons was by publication, the plaintifff may, in like manner,
apply for judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be made of
the demand mentioned in the complaint, and if the defendant be not a resident
of the state, must require the plaintifff or his agent to be examined on oath
respect ing any payments that have been made to the plaintifff, or to anyone
for his use on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount
which he is entitled to recover. Before rendering judgment the court may, in its
discretion, require the plaintifff to cause to be filed satisfac tory security,
to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution of any estate or
effects which may be directed by such judgment to be transferred or delivered,
or the res titution of any money that may be collected under and by virtue of
said judgment, in case the defendant or his repre sentatives shall apply and
be admitted to defend the action, and shall succeed in such defense. Notice. —
The five days' notice required is not now necessary upon a motion made in term
time, as the parties, through their counsel, must take notice, at their peril,
of all motions and steps in the cause at any term when the same is triable.
Clayton v. Jones, 68-497 ; University v. Lassiter, 83-38. Presumption of notice
of a motion does not apply to proceedings in the probate court. Blue v. Blue,
79-69. A defendant, served with summons in the action, is fixed with notice
of a judgment by default taken therein. McDaniel v. Watkins, 76-399. Presumed
to be correct. —Verdicts and judgments are presumed to be correct until the
contrary be shown. State v. Lanier, 89-517 ; Morris v. Gentry, 89-248. Failure
to take judgment by default.—A failure to take a judgment by default as soon
as it is allowable, does not work a discontinuance. Uni versity v. Lassiter,
83-38. Judgment by default final, regular.—A judgment by default final in an
action for money only, is regular when the defendant has accepted ser vice and
failed to answer. Walton v. Walton, 80-26. Judgment final may be rendered in
an action for the recovery of money where a specific sum is contracted to be
paid, where the complaint is sworn to and no answer filed. Rogers v. Moore,
86-85; Wynne v. Prairie, 86-73. Where the action is for a sum certain which the
defendant had prom ised to pay for goods sold and delivered, and the complaint
is sworn to, a judgment by default final can be taken where a frivolous demurrer
is filed. Adrian v. Jackson, 75-536. A judgment by default final cannot be
rendered unle*s the complaint is verified. Witt v. Long, 93-388 ; Hammerslaugh
v. Farrior, 95-135. Where the complaint alleges that the plaintifff sold to
the defendant certain goods, wares and merchandise, for which he promised to
pay a sum certain, and the complaint is verified, the plaintifff is entitled
to a judgment by default final upon a failure to answer, or upon the filing of
an unverified answer. H'artman v. Farrior, 95-177. See j! 531, and cases there
cited. Judgment by default final, irregular.—In an action sounding in damages
for an unliquidated money demand, a judgment by default final is irreg ular,
and on motion will be set aside. Moore v. Mitchell, 61-304 A judgment by default
final for want of answer in a suit upon a bailbond cannot be sustained. It
should have been a judgment by default and inquiry, and the damages assessed by
a jury. Roulhac v. Miller, 90-174. A judgment by default for want of an answer
against an additional party brought in during progress of the action and against
whom no complaint is filed, is irregular and may be set aside at any time. Vass
v. Building Association, 91-55. Where the judge left the court before the end of
the time limited, but did not adjourn the court, leaving it to expire by its own
limitation, and a judgment by default was entered against a defendant who filed
an answer before the expiration of such time, but after the departure of the
judge, the judgment should be set aside. Foley v. Blank, 92-476. clark's code
of civil procedure. A judgment by default final is irregular in an action on an
open account for goods sold and delivered, where there is no express contract
alleged in the complaint, but the plaintifffs only seek to recover on the
implied contract the reasonable value of their goods. In such case the judgment
should be by default and inquiry. Witt v. Xong, 93-3SS. Where it appeared,
upon inspection of the record, that the amount of the final judgment rendered
on default of answer could not be ascer tained by computation or be fixed by
the terms of the contract sued on, such judgment was irregular and should have
been set aside by the court, even though the demand for it was not based on
that ground. The overruling of a frivolous demurrer in such case leaves the
parties just as if it had not been filed. Skinner v. Terry, 107-103. Waiver of
jury. —Although the defendant has the right to have a jury pass upon an issue,
whether the debt sued for was incurred for the pur chase of the homestead (The
Code, j! 235), by failing to answer he waives that right. Durham v. Wilson,
104-595. Specialty sufficient complaint, if not objected to. —Filing the
specialty is a sufficient complaint, if objection is not taken before judgment.
Vick v. Pope, 81-22; Leach v. Railroad, 65-486. Proof need not be made before
the clerk. — By the act suspending The Code, a judgment by default rendered
by the superior court in term time on a former judgment is regular, without
proof being made before the clerk. Mabry v. Erwin, 78-45. Judgment against
administrator qualified prior to July, 1869. —A judgment by default against an
administrator appointed prior to July, 1869, ren dered in an action begun in
1882, conclusively fixes him with assets, not withstanding the complaint upon
which the judgment was based failed to allege that he was possessed of assets.

cases on the default calendar, and said calendar shall be called the first
day of the term. When the action is on a com plaint for the recovery of money
only, judgment may be given for the plaintifff by default, if the demand be
liquidated ; and if unliquidated, and the plaintifff itemize his account and
append thereto an affidavit that it is true and correct and no part of the sum
sued for has been paid, by discount or otherwise, and a copy be served with
the summons and complaint on the defendant, and the defendant shall neither
answer, demur nor serve notice of appearance, the plaintifff shall have judgment
for the sum sued for as in the case of liquidated demands. But in case notice
of appearance in an action has been given by or on behalf of a defendant, but
no answer or demurrer has been or thereafter shall be served within the time
required by law, the plaintifff, upon filing proof of such facts, shall have
his judgment by default against such defendant in the same manner and with like
effect as in cases where no notice of appearance has been given. In all other
cases the relief to be afforded the plaintifff shall be ascertained either by
the verdict of a jury, or in cases i n chancery by the Judge, with or without a
reference, as he may deem proper. The order for judgment in such cases shall be
endorsed upon or attached to the complaint. Where the defendant, by his answer
in any soch action, shall not deny the plaintifff's claim, but shall set up a
counterclaim amounting to less than the plaintifff's claim, judgment may be had
by the plaintifff for the excess of said claim over the said counterclaim, in
like manner in any such action, upon the plaintifff's filing with the Clerk of
the Court a statement ad mitting such counterclaim, which statement shall be
annexed to, and be a part of, the judgment roll. Where time to answer expires
after day fixed for opening of Court, but be fore Court is actually opened,
and no appearance, answer or demurrer has been served, the case may be docketed
and judgment by default taken.—McCoomb v. Woodxide, 13 S. C, 479. The omission
of the words, "have judgment," in the Judge.s order for judg ment endorsed on
the complaint is merely clerical, and does not vitiate the judgment.—Henlen
v. Graham, 32 S. C, 303. When defendant does not deny plaintifff's claim, but
sets up a counterclaim, the plaintifff upon filing with the Clerk an admission
of such counterclaim is entitled, on call of default docket, to judgment for
excess claimed above the counterclaim.—Burges v. Pollitzer, 19 S. C, 451. when

granted, the clerk must enter the default of the defendant ; and thereafter
the plaintifff may apply to the court for the relief demanded in the complaint.
If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is· necessary to enable
the court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the court

106. Judgment may be had if the defendant. fail to answer the complaint as
notified by the summons as follows: First. In case of default adjudged against
a party for nonappearance or for failure to plead or amend his pleadings,
as required by law or the rules of the court, when the action is for a money
demand, and the amount of the proper judgment is a mere matter of computation.
the clerk shall ascertain the amount. When long accounts are to be examined, the
court may refer the matter. In other cases the court shall assess the damages,
unless a jury be demanded by the party not in default. The proper amount having
been ascertained by either of the above methods, judgment shall be rendered
therefore. Second. In other actions, if no answer has been filed with the clerk
of the court wit-hin the time specified in the summons or such further time as
may have been granted, the court or judge, upon application of the plaintifff,
must enter the default of the defendant and render judgment. If the taking of
an account or the proof of any fact is necessary to enable the court to give
judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take the account or
hear the proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that purpose.
And where the action is for the recovery of damages, in whole or in part, the
court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury in term time, or, if to
determine the amount of damages the examination of a long account be involved,
by reference. as herein provided. Third. In actions where the service of the
summons is by publication, the plaintifff, upon the expiration of the time for
answering, may, upon proof of the publication and that no answer has been filed,
apply for judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be made of the
demand mentioned in the complaint, and, if the defendant be not a resident of
the territory, may require the plaintifff or his agent to be examined on oath
respecting any payments that have been made to the plaintifff or to any one for
his use on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount which
he is entitled to recover.
