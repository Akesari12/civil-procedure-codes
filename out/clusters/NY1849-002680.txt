foreign corporation is valid to the ex tent that the cause of action arose in
this State. — Central R. R. Co. v. Georgia Co., 32 S. C, 319. But attachment
will not lie in action of resident adminis trator against non-resident guardian
of infants residing in another State be cause such action cannot be maintained.

action, if it state a cause of action, or if it state facts from which, as a
legal conclusion, it must be inferred that it does exist.— Monday v. Elmore, 27
S. C, 126 ; Central R. R. Co. v. Georgia Co., 32 S. C, 319; Roddey v. Erwin, 31
S. C, 36 ; Bank v. Stelling, 31 S. C, 360 ; Ketehen v. Landecker, 32 S. C, 155.

is sufficient if it state that fact without other facts and circumstances. —
Smith v. Walker, 6 S. C, 156 ; Roddey v. Erwin, 31 S. C, 36. Bat as to all
the other grounds, the affidavit must positively state the facts; and if upon
information, it must also state the sources of information and circumstances
relied on to show them.—Smith v. Walker, 6 S. C, 169 ; Brown v. Morris, 10 S. C,
467 ; Clausen v. Fultz, 13 S. C, 478 ; Burch v. Brantley, 20 S. C, 5C6 ; Ivy v.

of the affidavits filed will suffice.— Wagener v. Booker, 31 S.C.. 375. Where
the affidavits are not filed in ten days the attachment will be dis charged on
motion.— Ketehen v. Landecker, 32 S. C, 155. Service of copies on the defendant
