Affidavit indispensable prerequisite. —The court will not hear a cause,
under this section, in the absence of the affidavit required by it. Heryey v.
Edmunds, 68-243; Grant v. Newsom, 81-36; Wilmington v. Atkin son, 88-54; Jones
v. Commissioners, 88-56. Submission must be to a court having jurisdiction. —
The submission must be to a court which would have jurisdiction if the action
had been com menced by summons. Jones v. Commissioners, 88-56. Purpose of
this section. —This section does not confer on parties who differ as to their
rights authority to propound to the court, on a case agreed, interrogatories
in respect thereto. The purpose of the section is simply to dispense with the
formalities of a summous, complaint and answer, and, upon an agreed state of
facts, to submit the case to the court for decision. McKethan v. Ray, 71-165;
Little v. Thorne, 93-69. Statement of facts. —In the submission of a controversy
without action, the statement of facts upon which the judgment of the court is
asked should not be a mere narration of the facts out of which the controversy
arises, but should contain a statement of the subject-matter and nature of
the controversy, and of the conflicting claims of litigants. Overman v. Sims,
96-451. The summary method provided by The Code for the submission of an action
upon a case agreed contemplates that all the facts necessary to a determination
of the questions submitted shall be fully stated in the case agreed; and where
it appeared that some of the facts were recited in exhibits which were not
attached, and that leave was given the parties to add other matters, the cause
was remanded to be perfected. Railroad v. Reidsville, 101-404. Trial by jury
does not obtain. —The statute allowing controversies, with out action, to be
submitted upon a "case agreed," does not contemplate a trial by jury. Moore v.

vaca tion upon verdict given in term. Harrell v. Peebles, 79-26. But not without
consent of parties. Hardin v. Ray, 89-364. Judgment can be entered by consent
of parties in vacation. Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243. Appeal from opinion without
judgment rendered.—Where, in a case under this section, an appeal is taken upon
the judge's filing an opinion, but without rendering judgment, the case will
be remanded at the appel lant's costs. Moore v. Hinnant, 87 505. Cases to which
this section does not apply.—Where a sheriff has money in his hands raised
under executions in favor of different creditors against the same defendant, and
the creditors set up conflicting claims to the money, it is not such a case as
may be submitted to a judge, without action under this section by the adverse
claimants. Bates v. Li1ley, 65-232.
