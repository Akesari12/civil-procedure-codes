265. Libel and Slander, how stated in complaint. C. C. P., s. 124. In an action
for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint
any extrinsic facts, for the pur pose of showing the application to the
plaintifff of the defamatory matter out of -which the cause of action arose ;
but it shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published or
spoken concerning the plaintifff; and if such allegation be controverted, the
plaintifff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was so published or
spoken. Sufficient statement.—In case of a demurrer to a complaint in an action
for libel, upon the ground that it was " too vague and indefinite to war rant a
judgment," the court say, Rodman, J., delivering the opinion : "This section was
intended to do away with the refined and subtle dis tinctions, which had found
a place in the common law pleadings in actions for libel." When a complaint
alleges that " the defendant pub lished, concerning the plaintifff, in a
newspaper," etc., "a certain article containing the false and defamatory matter
following. 1 ' etc. , it sufficiently avers that the defamatory matter was
concerning the plaintifff. Carson v. Mills, 69-122. In an action for slander it
is material only to aver in the complaint that the slanderous words were spoken
of the plaintifff ; the facts which point them and convey to the hearer the
sense in which they are used, are matters of proof before the jury. Wozelka v.
Hettrick, 93-10. Negative averments not necessary. —The plaintifff in an action
for slander is not required to negative in his complaint that words actionable
per se were not spoken in such a manner or under such circumstances as rendered
them privileged, and this though it appeared from the com plaint that they were
spoken in or about a judicial proceeding. Gudger v. Penland, 108-593.
