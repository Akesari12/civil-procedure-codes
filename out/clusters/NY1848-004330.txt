mentis, if the statement required by this section is verified by the guardian,
in the absence of fraud, is not irregular. McAden v. Hooker, 74-24. A judgment
confessed under this section must contain a concise, veri fied statement of the
facts and transactions out of which the indebted ness arose. A mere statement
that the defendant is indebted to the plaintifff in a certain sum "arising
from the acceptance of a draft," setting out a copy thereof, is not sufficient.
Davidson v. Alexander, 84-621. Where the affidavit of the debtor set out that
he was justly indebted to the judgment creditor in a certain amount, but did not
embrace the account which was filed, this was not a compliance with the statute,
and the judgment was void. Davenport v. Leary, 95-203. The requirements of this
