368. 1. Upon hearing appeal, the appellate Court shall judgment on give judgment
according to the justice of the case without appeal; new ~ trial. regard to
technical errors and defects which do not affect the lb., 8asa. merits. In
giving judgment, the Court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the Court
below, in whole or in part, and as to any or all the parties, and for errors of
law or fact. If the appeal is founded on an error in fact in the proceedings,
not ' affecting the merits of the action, and not within the knowledge of the
Trial Justice, the Court may determine the alleged error in fact on affidavits,
and may, in its discretion, inquire into and determine the same upon examination
of the witnesses. If the defendant failed to appear before the Trial Justice,
and it is shown by the affidavits served by the appellant, or otherwise, that
manifest injustice has been done, and he satisfactorily ex cuses his default,
the Court may, in its discretion, set aside or suspend judgment, and order a
new trial, before the same or any Trial Justice in the same County, at such time
and place, and on such terms, as the Court may deem proper. Where a new trial
shall be ordered before a Trial Justice, the parties must appear before him
according to the order of the Court, and the same proceedings must thereupon be
had in the action as on the re turn of a summons personally served. The Supreme
Court will not lend a ready ear to any objections based upon mere matter of
form ; but will decide without regard to technical errors and defects.—Dargan
v. West, 27 S. C., 156. And the Circuit Court will, in order to do justice when
the verdict in Trial Justice Court is not in proper form, send the case back
there for new trial.— DuBose v. Armstrong, 29 S. C, 290. The Circuit Court,
on appeal, can review and reverse errors of fact in Trial Justice's Court.—

Trial Justice not excepted to. — Burns v. Gower, 34 S. C, 160. The only mode
of relief from a Trial Justice's judgment, rendered against a party through his
excusable defaults, is by appeal to the Circuit Court.—Doty v. Duvall, 19 S.
C, 143 ; Wolfe v. R. R. Co., 25 S. C, 879 ; Lawrence v. Isear, 27 S. C, 244.
Such relief applies only to cases of judgment by default, and not where there
was trial.—Miller v. Schmidt, 20 S. C, 58S ; Green v. County Commis sioners,
27 S. C, 9. Whether Circuit Court can remand a case to County Commissioners
for new trial not determined.— Green v. County Commissioners, 27 S. C, 9. 2.
If the issue joined before the Trial Justice was an issue of law, the Court
shall render judgment thereon according to the law of the case ; and if such
judgment be against the pleadings of either party, an amendment of such pleading
may be allowed on the same terms, and in like case, as pleadings in actions in
the Circuit Court, and the Court may thereupon require the opposite party to
answer such amended pleading, or join issue thereon, as the case may require,
summarily. 3. If, upon an appeal in an issue of law, the Court should adjudge
the pleading complained of to be valid, it shall, in like manner, require
the opposite party summarily to answer such pleading, or join issue thereon,
as the case may require. 4. Every issue of fact so joined or brought upon an
appeal shall be tried in the manner as provided in Section 358. 1873 xv. soa
5. The Court shall have the same power over its own determi t id. nations,
and shall render judgment thereon in the same manner, as the Circuit Court
in actions pending therein, without trial by jury, and may allow either party
to amend his pleadings upon such terms as shall be just ; and in any appeal,
either party may, at any time before the trial, 8erve upon the opposite party
an offer, in writing, to allow judgment to be taken against him for the sum or
property, or to the effect in such offer specified, and with or without costs,
as said offer shall specify. If the party receiving such offer accept the same,
and give notice thereof, in writing, within ten days, he may file the return
and offer, with an affidavit of service of notice of acceptance thereof, and
judg ment shall be entered thereon according to said offer. If the notice of
acceptance be not given, the offer is to be deemed with drawn, and cannot be
given in evidence. And if the party to whom such offer is made fail to obtain a
judgment more favor able to him than that specified in said offer, then he shall
not recover costs, but must pay the other party's costs from the date of the
service of the offer. 6. Either party may move for a new trial in said Court on
a case or exceptions, or otherwise, and such motion may be made before or after
judgment has been entered ; and the provisions of this Code of Procedure in
relation to the proceedings, excep tions to the decisions of the Court, making
and settling cases and exceptions, motions for new trials, and making up the
judgment roll in the Circuit Court, are hereby made applicable to all ap peals
brought up for trial, as in this Chapter provided, judgment roii.
