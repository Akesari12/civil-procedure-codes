2815. Petition for security from testamentary trustee. Any per son, beneficially
interested in the execution of the trust, may present to the surrogate's court
a written petition, duly verified, setting forth, either upon his knowledge, or
upon his information and belief, any fact, respecting a testamentary trustee,
the existence of which, if it was interposed as an objection to granting letters
testamentary to a person named as executor in a will, would make it necessary
for such a person to give security, in order to entitle himself to letters ;
and praying for a decree, directing the testa mentary trustee to give security
for the performance of his trust ; and that he may be cited to show cause, why
such a decree should not be made. Upon the presentation of such a petition, the
surrogate, must issue a citation accordingly. Upon the return of the citation, a
decree, requiring the testa mentary trustee to give such security, may be made,
in a case where a per son so named as executor can entitle himself to letters
testamentary, only by giving a bond ; but not otherwise.
