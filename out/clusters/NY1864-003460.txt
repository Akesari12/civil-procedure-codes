326. The Clerk shall insert in the entry of judgment, lu'iiKiiiente? ad" on the
application of the prevailing party, upon live days' notice terkS'ry'costo to
the other, except when the attorneys reside in the same city, lb., 8837. village
or town, and then upon two days' notice, the sum of the allowances for costs
and disbursements, as provided by law, the necessary disbursements, including
the fees of officers allowed by law, the fees of witnesses, the reasonable
compensation of com missioners in taking depositions, the fees of referees,
and the expense of printing the papers for any hearing, when required by a
rule of the Court. The disbursements shall be stated in detail and verified by
affidavit. A copy of the items of the costs and disbursements shall be served,
with a notice of adjustment. Whenever it shall be necessary to adjust costs in
any interlocu tory proceeding in an action, or in any special proceedings, the
same shall be adjusted by the Judge before whom the same may be heard, or the
Court before which the same may be decided or pending, or in such other manner
as the Judge or Court may direct. Thin Section does not require that the costs
and disbursements shall be taxed by the Clerk exclusively ; but the Court in
equity cases has control of the question of costs.—Dial v. Tappan, 20 S. C,
167. And it does not prevent taxation by the Master.—lb. But erroneous taxa
tion directed by the Court will be reviewed by the Supreme Court. —lulling v.
Foster, 21 S. C, 334. Unless the costs have been taxed by the Clerk and a motion
to correct the taxation has been decided in the Court l>elow, the Supreme Court
will not con sider any question as to same. — Bradley v. Rodlesperger, 6 S. C,
291 ; Dilling v. Foster, 21 S. C, 334 ; Cooke v. Poole, 26 S. C, 321 ; Heeht
v. Friesleben, 28 S. C, 1S1 ; Armstrong v. Friesleben, 28 S. C, 605. But when
the taxation has been heard and confirmed by Circuit Court, ap peal lies to
Supreme Court.— Stegall v. Holt, 11 S. C, 522. But such order of confirmation
is not a final judgment that allows previous orders to be re viewed. —Huffman
v. Stork, 23 S. C. , 267. Notice of taxation may be given by Clerk as well as
by the attorneys.— Cureton v. Westfleld, 24 S. C, 457. The fees of the officers
and witnesses are in theory the disbursements paid by prevailing party ; but it
is not error to tax them as due to them.— Lewis v. Brown, 16 S. C, 5S. And the
costs of the officers need not be sworn to or cer tified by them.— Cureton v.
Westfleld, 24 S. C, 451. Production of subpoena writ is not necessary to entitle
witness to tax his fees.—/ b. Disbursements must be taxed under the fee bill in
force at time incurred.— lb. But they most be verified or not allowed.- Cureton
v. Westfleld, 24 S. C, 457. "A rule of Court" means a pre-existing rule of
general operation, and not a mere order pro hoc vice.—Scott v. Alexander, 27 S.
C, 15. The rules of Court require printing of papers only in the Supreme Court ;
so that printing of papers in the Circuit Court cannot be taxed.—/6. Fees of
stenographer cannot be taxed. —lb.
