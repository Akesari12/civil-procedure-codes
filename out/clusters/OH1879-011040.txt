5833. Certain sureties may require creditors to sue. A person bound as surety
in a written instrument for the payment of money, or other valuable thing, may,
if a right of action accrue thereon, require his creditor, by notice in writing,
to commence an action on such instru ment forthwith, against the principal
debtor ; and unless the creditor commence such action within a reasonable time
thereafter, and proceed with due diligence, in the ordinary course of law, to
recover judgment against the principal debtor for the money or other valuable
thing due thereby, and to make, by execution, the amount thereof, the creditor,
or the assignee of such instrument, so failing to comply with the requisition
of such surety, shall thereby forfeit the right which he would otherwise have
to demand and receive of such surety the amount due thereon. [61 v. 19, ? 1 ;
S. & S. 741.] The notice must be in writing, 41 O. S. 28, and pleaded, 7 O.
(Pt. 1) 229. No particular form or words are required. A sub stantial compliance
with the statute is sufficient, 41 O. S. 28 ; 44 O. S. 4JiO. A notice which
is positive in its request to sue, and does not mislead the creditor as to the
instrument to be sued on, is sufficient, Id. A notice, "You are hereby required
at once to proceed and collect the note you hold upon which I am surety. ...
I will stand no longer," is sufficient, 40 O. S. 101. The no tice must contain
an unconditional requirement to commence the action forthwith. A notice that
the surety " wishes " the creditor " to proceed against the principal debtor"
and collect "the claim, or have it arranged in some way," and that the surety
does " not wish to remain bail any longer," is not suffi cient, 29 O. S. 663.
The duty of the creditor to proceed within a reasonable time after such notice
is imperative. It is the right of the surety to require that action be brought
against the principal and diligently proceeded with ; and this right is not
affected by the fact of solvency or insolvency of such principal, 44 O. S. 430.
Where the principal and surety are residents within the same jurisdiction, the
duty of the creditor to commence an action, as required, is not affected by
the fact that he is a resident of another state, Id. To entitle the surety upon
a note to the benefit of this section, it is not necessary that the fact of
suretyship should appear upon the face of the note, Id. Under a similar statute
it was held that when the surety gave notice to the creditor to sue, it was not
a compliance with the statute to sue the surety alone, 2 O. 303.
