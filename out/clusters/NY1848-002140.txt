291. In what cases. C. L\ P., s. 149. R.C.,c.31,s. 54. 1777, c. 11S, s. 0.
1809-'70, c. 79, s. 1. 1891, c. 541, s. 1. The defendant may be arrested,
as hereinafter prescribed, in the following cases : (1) In an action for the
recovery of damages, on a cause of action not arising out of contract, where
the defendant is not a resident of the state, or is about to remove there from,
or where the action is for an injury to person or character, or for injuring,
or for wrongfully taking, detain ing or converting property real or personal;
NOTE. —The words " real or personal " at the end of this subsection were added
by ch. 541, acts 1891. Insufficient affidavits.^—An affidavit that the defendant
is "about to leave the state " is in sufficient to obtain an order of arrest,
because— 1. It does not set forth that it is with the intent to defraud his
cred itors ; and 2. It does not state the ground of affiant's belief that the
defendant is about to commit the act apprehended ; which is necessary to be
done in order that the court may perceive that he has reasonable cause for
such apprehension. Wilson v. Barnhill, 64-121. An affidavit alleging that the
defendant "is about to remove from the state of North Carolina, to become a
resident of the state of Virginia," is insufficient' if it does not state the
reasons of the belief in regard to what is about to occur, in order that the
court may judge whether his apprehensions be reasonable or not. Wood v. Harrell,
74-338. Applied to personal property only.—The provision in this section, for
the arrest of a defendant, " for injuring or for wrongfully taking, detaining
or converting property," has reference to personal and not real properly,
notwithstanding the definition of the word property in \ 3765 (6). Bridgers
v. Taylor, 102-86. Notk. —This decision was prior to the amendment of 1891
above stated. When grounds of belief must be stated. —When the plaintifff, in
his affi davit to obtain an order of arrest, relies upon his apprehension of
what the defendant is aboul to do, as "remove from the state," "secrete his
property," etc., he must state the grounds on which he bases such apprehensive
belief, in his affidavit ; but when he relies on a fact already accomplished,
it is sufficient, if such facts be stated in the words of The Code authorizing
the arrest, as that the defendant "has secreted his property with intent to
defraud his creditors," etc. Hughes v. Per son, 63-548. In an application for
an order of arrest, the applicant is recjuired to set forth fully and with legal
precision the facts which constitute his alleged cause of action. If they are
of his own knowledge, they should be positively stated, and if they are upon
belief, he should state the sources of his information, so that the court can
determine if a proper cause of action exists. Harris v. Sueeden, 101-273. Rumor.
—Mere general rumor that a person indebted has removed to another state is not
sufficient to justify his creditor in suing out a war rant for his arrest. There
should be such evidence as would induce a reasonable man to believe that the
facts existed upon which he based his application. Tucker v. Wilkins, 105-272.
Construction of statute. —Where the terms of a statutewhich has received
judicial construction are used in a later statute, that construction is to be
given to those terms in the later statute. Bridgers v. Taylor, 102-86. When
cause of arrest is stated in the complaint.—The cause for arrest, when set
forth in the complaint, must be stated with as much explicitness as when set
forth in an affidavit. Peebles v. Foote, 83-102. Constitutional prohibition of
imprisonment for debt.—The constitutional prohibition of imprisonment for debt
does not protect from an arrest under this section in actions for tort. Moore
v. Green, 73-394; Long v. McLean, 88-3. Slander of title.— It is questionable
if an order of arrest may be properly granted in an action for slander of title.
Harris v. Sneeden, 101-273. Seduction of a daughter.—The seduction of a daughter
is an injury to the person of the father, within the meaning of this section,
and a suf ficient ground for arrest. Hoover v. Palmer, 80-313. See now express
words of subsection 2. See \ 447, post, and cases there cited. (2) Iil an action
for a fine or penalty, or for seduction, or for money received, or for property
embezzled or fraudu lently misapplied by a public officer, or by an attorney,
solicitor or counsellor, or by an officer or agent of a corpo ration or banking
association, in the course of bis employ ment as such, or by any factor,
agent, broker or other per son in a fiduciary capacity, or for any misconduct
or neglect in office, or in a professional employment; Administrator. —An
administrator who has been fixed with assets which are not forthcoming is not
thereby necessarily found guilty of fraud, so as to subject him to arrest under
this section. Melvin v. Melvin, 72-384. Promise to marry. —The provision of this
section, authorizing the arrest of the defendant "in an action on a promise to
marry," is in violation of Art. 1, 16 of the Constitution, which provides that
"There shall be no imprisonment for debt, except in cases of fraud." "A breach
of promise to marry," says Pearson, C J., "is no more a 'case of fraud' than
a breach of any other promise. The purpose in McNeely v. Haynes, 76- 122, was
to restrain that decision to the case in hand, as we do this, so as to let the
other subsections stand on their own construction, except so far as these two
cases may furnish analogies." Moore v. Mullen, 77-327Qucere, whether, in a case
of breach of promise of marriage, accom panied with seduction and an attempt to
flee the state, the element of fraud would justify the defendant's arrest. Ibid.
Note.—The words " on a promise to marry " (on which Moore v. Mul len, ante,
was decided) have since been stricken out of this subsection. Seduction. —This
subsection, authorizing the arrest of a person in an action for seduction, is
not in conflict with the provision of the Consti tution prohibiting imprisonment
for debt. Kinney v. Laughenour, 97-325Applies to all fiduciary relations.—This
subsection is intended to embrace all cases where the relation of trust and
confidence in respect to money received or personal property in possession by
one party for the benefit of another is raised by contract. Travers v. Deaton,
107-500. Where the defendant agreed to receive and sell for plaintifff, for
cash and on time, certain guano described, himself becoming liable and indebted
for its value at an agreed price, accounting and turning over to plaintifff
the guano unsold and the proceeds of all sales, this consti tuted a fiduciary
relationship embraced by this subsection, and if the defendant convert such
funds to his own use, he is liable to arrest. Travers v. Deaton, 107-500. Agent.
—A debtor endorsed to his creditor certain notes as collateral security, but
retained possession of them under an agreement that lie was to collect when due,
and pay the proceeds to the creditor : Held, that this made him the agent of the
creditor, and subjected him to arrest in a civil action for fraudulently failing
to account for the sums he col lected under the agreement. Powers v. Davenport,
101-286. (3) In an action to recover the possession of personal property,
unjustly detained, where the property or any part thereof has been concealed,
removed or disposed of, so that it cannot be found or taken by the sheriff, and
with the intent that it should not be so found or taken, or with the intent to
deprive the plaintifff of the benefit thereof; Fraud after contracting debt.
—A person may be arrested and held to bail for a fraud committed after the
contracting of the debt, e. g., by con cealing property, or other devices for
defeating the creditor. Powers v. Davenport, 101-286. (4) When the defendant
has been guilty of a fraud in contracting the debt, or incurring the obligation
for which the action is brought', or in concealing or disposing of the property
for the taking, detention or conversion of which the action is brought, or
when the action is brought to recover damages for fraud or deceit; Affidavit
sufficient. —Where the plaintifff alleged in his affidavit that the defendant
had sold him a patent right, representing it to be genuine and no infringement
on any other patent, which was false, and that the defendant was a non-resident,
the order was properly issued. Bahnson v. Cheseboro, 77-325. Fraud of one
partner. —The fact that one partner has obtained goods for the firm by false
representations does not make the other partner liable to arrest therefore,
unless he is shown to be guilty of the fraud, and an affidavit charging one
partner with such fraud will not justify the arrest of the other. McNeely v.
Haynes, 76-122. Non-resident. —A non-resident of this state may be arrested and
held to bail for fraud under this subsection. Powers v. Davenport, 101-286. (5)
When the defendant has removed or disposed of his property, or is about to do
so, with intent to defraud his creditors; Information and belief. —An affidavit,
alleging the debt and fraud in con tracting, and "upon information and belief,"
a concealment of property by the defendant, is good. Paige v. Price, 78-10;
Peebles v. Foote, 83102. See Cowles v. Hardin, 79-517. Statement of reasons
for belief. —An affidavit, stating that " the defend ant has disposed of his
property with intent to defraud his creditors," is good, if it stops there.
When, however, it proceeds to give a reason for that belief, the reason must
be sufficient or the affidavit will not suffice. So when it adds, " In this,
that although he has received from the plain tiffs alone over $7,000 in specie
and $7,600 in currency, and owes upward of $3,000, he has not paid any of his
debts," is insufficient to justify the arrest of the defendant. Smith v. Gibson,
74-684. (6) But no woman shall be arrested in any action, except for a willful
injury to person, character or property ; and no person shall be arrested on
Sunday. Arrest on Sunday.—The arrest of the defendant is illegal if made on Sun
day. Devries v. Summit, 86-126 ; White v. Morris, 107-92.
