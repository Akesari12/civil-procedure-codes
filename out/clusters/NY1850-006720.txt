complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of
other parties, the court must cause them to be brought in. And when in an action
for the recovery of real or personal property, a person not a party to the
action, but having an interest in the subject-matter thereof, makes application
to the court to be made a party, it may order him to be brought in by the proper
amendment. A defendant against whom an action is pending upon a contract or for
specific real or personal property, upon proof by affidavit that a person not
a party to the action makes a demand against him for the same debt or property
without collusion with him, may, at any time before answer, apply to the court,
upon notice to that person and the adverse party, for an order to substitute
that person in his place, and to discharge him from liability to either, on his
paying into court the amount of the debt, or delivering the possession of the
property, or its value, to such person as the court shall direct. The court, in
its discretion, may make such an order. Application for dower. —Where a widow,
as general devisee of her hus band's estate, has conveyed a large portion of
the land in trust to secure her own debts, and then dissents from the will and
asks for dower, the trustee is not a necessary party to her petition. Ramsour
v. Ramsour, 63-231. The court may permit a creditor of a person, who died seized
and pos sessed of lands, to be made a party to a proceeding for dower, and con
test the claim of the widow. Welfare v. Welfare, 108-272. Action to recover
real property.—Where both the plaintifff and a third party claim to be the
landlord of the defendant, such third person has a right,^ upon affidavit, to
be let in as a party defendant to an action to recover such property. Rollins v.
Rollins, 76-264. If in such an action judgment is rendered against the tenant,
no writ of possession will issue till the controversy is also decided between
the plaintifff and the intervener. Rollins v. Henry, 76-269. In a suit by a
purchaser at an execution sale seeking to dispossess the husband of the wife's
land, the wife's possessory right is such an interest in the controversy as
entitles her to be made a party defendant. Cecil v. Smith, 81-285 ; Young v.
Greenlee, 82-346. In an action for the recovery of real property, a person who
