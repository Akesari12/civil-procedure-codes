cited, $ 341, post. Summons need not be served. —The issuing of the summons
is the com mencement of the action, and it is not necessary that it shall be
served before the injunction or restraining order is made. Fleming v. Patter
son, 99-404. One who willfully disobeys an injunction or restraining order, is
guilty of contempt, though the summons in the action may not have been served
upon him. Ibid. Waiver of irregularity.—An injunction order can only be granted
at the time of the issue of the summons or afterwards. If it be granted before,
or if it direct the issue of a summons, it is irregular, and will be dissolved
on motion. But if the defendant answer the complaint, and objection be not
taken till the trial, the irregularity is deemed to have been waived, and the
court will not notice it, sua sponte. Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612 ; McArthur v.
McEachin, 64-72 ; Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65-516. Affidavit. —In an application

stated in the complaint is true, can not be considered, he having stated nothing

affidavit for a provisional remedy is suffi ciently verified, when made before a
commissioner of this state, resi dent in another state, and authenticated by his
