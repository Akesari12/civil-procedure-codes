1862. The following are the rules, for construing the descriptive part of a
conveyance of real property, when the construction is doubtful, and there are
no other sufficient circumstances to determine it: 1. Where there are certain
definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others,
which are indefinite, unknown or false, does not frustrate the conveyance, but
it is to be construed by the first mentioned particulars: 2. When permanent
and visible, or ascertained boundaries or monuments, are inconsistent with the
measurement, either of lines, angles or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments
are paramount: 3. Between different measurements, which are inconsistent with
each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines,
paramount to both: 4. When a road, or a stream of water not navigable, is the
boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road, or the thread
of the stream, are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed
of the stream is held under another title; 5. When tide water is the boundary,
the rights of the grantor to low water mark are included in the conveyance: 6.
When the description refers to a map, and that reference is inconsistent with
other particulars, it controls them, if it appear, that the parties acted with
reference to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to other definite, and
ascertained particulars.

845. The following are the rules, for construing the descriptive part of a
conveyance of real property, when the construction is doubtful, and there are
no other sufficient circumstances to determine it: 1. Where there are certain
definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others,
which are indefinite, unknown, or false, does not frustrate the conveyance,
but it is to be construed by such particulars, if they constitute a suiiicient
description, to ascertain its application. 2. When permanent and visible, or
ascertained boundaries or monuments, are inconsistent with the measurement,
either of lines, angles or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount;
3. Between different measurements, which are inconsistent with each other,
that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines paramount to
both ; 4. When a road or a stream of water not navigable, is the boundary, the
rights of the grantor to the middle of the road, or the thread of the stream,
are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed of the stream is
held under another title; 5. When tide water is the boundary, the rights of the
grantor to low Water mark are included in the conveyance, and also the right of
this state between high and low Water mark; 6. When the description refers to
a map, and that reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it controls
them, if it appear that the parties acted with reference to the map; otherwise
the map is subordinate to other definite, and ascertained particulars.

which are indefinite, unknown, or false, does not frustrate the conveyance, but

855. [845.] The following are the rules for con- ' struing the descriptive
part of a conveyance of real prop erty, when the construction is doubtful, and
there are no other suﬁicient circumstances to determine it:— 1. Where there are
certain deﬁnite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition
of others, which are indeﬁnite, unknown, or false, does not frustrate the
conveyance, but it is to be construed by such partic- ulars, if they constitute
a suﬂicient description to ascer tain its application; 2. When permanent and
visible or ascertained boun-t ldaries or monuments are inconsistent with the
measure ment, either of lines, angles, or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments
are paramount; 3. Between diﬁ'erent measurements which are incon sistent with
each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines
paramount to both; 4. \Vhen a road or stream of water not navigable is ' the
boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road, or the thread
of the stream, are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed of
the stream is held under another title; \ 5. When tide-water is the boundary,
the rights of the grantor to low-water mark are included in the convey ance,
and also the right of this state between high and low water mark; 6. When the
description refers to a map, and that reference is inconsistent with other
particulars, it con trols them, if it appear that the parties acted with
refer ence to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to other deﬁnite and
ascertained particulars. Description generally. — It was granted premises, it
was re arded as held that when one deed referred to of the same effect as if
the atber was ,,a.nother for a description of the copied into the deed itself:
Vance v. Fore, 24 Cal. 444; Saunders v. Schwei zle, 49 Id. 59; Alli‘)! v. Bates,
6 Pick. 460; Foes v. Crisp, W Id. 121. When lines are laid down upon a plan, and
referred to accordingly in a. deed, they are to be regarded as iving the true
description of the parce , as much as if recited in the deed itself: Vance V.
Fm, 24 Cal. 444; Davis V. Rains ford, 17 Mass. 207; Purchase v. Tif It was held
that arbitrary rules of Oct 11, 1862, construction were not to be invoked Q 845.
if the intention of the parties could be plainly discovered without their aid:
Kimball v. Semple, 25 Cal. 441. If a. deed contains diﬁ‘crcnt descrip tions, one
of which applies to land which the grantor owned, and the other to land which
he did not own, the former will be taken as true and fmy, 1 Me. 219; Thomas v.
Patten, 13 the latter as false: Piper v. True, 36 Id. 329; Lunt v. llolland,
14 Mass. Cal. 607. Any description will sulﬁce 149; dliller v. Cullum, 4 Ala.

set such certainty that the speciﬁc parcel forth in the description, it will be
intended to be ascertained, either by suﬁicient: Sherman v. ll[cCartJn/, 57 the
calls of the instrument as applied Cal. 507. To the point that oun to the land,
or by aid of the descrip daries and monuments govern courses tive portions of
the grant: Banks v. and distances, see Lewis v. Lewis, 4 Or. 177.
