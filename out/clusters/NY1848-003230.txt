of execution.—The act of assembly, \ 449, post, by which execu tions issued on
judgments in civil actions are required to be tested as of the term next before
the day on which they are issued, is merely direc tory, and its omission does
not vitiate the process. Bryan v. Hubbs, 69-423; Williams v. Weaver, 94-134.
Against property—no lien on personal properly until levy. (1) If it be against
the property of the judgment debtor, it shall require the officer to satisfy the
judgment out of the personal property of such debtor; and if sufficient personal
property cannot be found, out of the real property belonging to him on the day
when the judgment was dock eted in the county, or at any time thereafter; but
no exe cution against the property of the judgment debtor shall be a lien on
the personal property of such debtor, as against any bona fide purchaser from
him for value, or as against any other execution, except from the levy thereof.
Year's support. —Personal property allotted to a widow as her year's support is
subject to seizure and sale under an execution issued upon a judgment recovered
against her deceased husband in his life-time, tested before his death but
issued thereafter. Grant v. Hughes, 82-216. Note. —This was changed by chap.
42, acts 1SS0. Effect of levy. —A levy on land, by virtue of an execution, may
(the court intimates) be an appropriation of the land requiring its sale before
resorting to other lands to which some equitable right has attached. If this
is not so, it is a mere nullity, for the lien is conferred by the docketing
of the judgment. Barnes v. Hiatt, 87-315; Surratt v. Crawford, S7-372; Farrior
v. Houston, 100-369. When an execution is issued on an undocketed judgment, or
one which has lost its lien on real estate by the lapse of time, it is a lien
on noth real and personal property from its levy. Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321.
If an execution issued on a judgment more than ten years after the docketing,
but which is not dormant, or to a county in which the judg ment has never
been docketed, a sale of both real and personal property under it is valid,
but the lien only relates to the levy. Lytle v. Lytle, 94-683. An execution
is rot a lien on the personal property of the judgment debtor as against bona
fide purchasers from its teste, but only from the levy, Weisenfield v. McLean,
96-248. Where there has been more than one constructive levy they should be
paid off in the order of the time they were made. Penland v. L,eatherwood,
101-509. When a levy is made upon personal property, the officer making the levy
thereby acquires a special property therein, which he holds for the purpose of
satisfying the execution in his hands, and after that has been done he should
apply the remainder of the proceeds of the sale to the satisfaction of other
executions in his hands at the time of the sale. Ibid. If personal property has
been seized by one officer under execution, another officer, having executions
also, may make a second or construc tive levy, by going to the property and
endorsing his levy on his pro cess, but he has no right to take possession
until the first levy is satisfied; it is the duty of the first officer, having
notice of the sub sequent levy, to apply any surplus proceeds of his sale to
the execu tions so afterwards levied. Ibid. Levy constructive payment, when. —
A levy by the sheriff on goods, when he allows them to remain in the hands of
the debtor, or when the debtor regains possession after seizure, against the
will of the sheriff, is not satisfaction of the execution. A levy is only held
to be a constructive payment to prevent a wrong, as where the sheriff seizes
goods and will not sell them. Alridge v. Loftin, 104-122; In re King, 13-341;
Binford v. Alston, 15-351. What constitutes a levy. —To constitute a levy a
seizure is necessary. If, from the nature of the property, au actual seizure
is impossible, some act as nearly equivalent to the seizure as practicable
must be substituted for it. Long v. Hall, 97-286. While a levy may be made
upon real property without the officer being at or taking formal possession of
it, it is necessary, to constitute a valid levy on personal property, that the
officer should go to it, and have it in his power, to take possession of it,
if necessary. Perry v. Hardison, 99-21. As against junior execution creditors,
it is necessary to the validity of a levy of a senior execution upon personal
property that the officer should take into his possession and retain, either in
person or by an agent for that purpose, the property seized, until a sale. As
against other persons, including perchasers for value, a levy on personal prop
erty, by going to it, so as to have power to take it into his possession, if
the officer choses, and endorsing it on his process, will be good, though actual
possession may not have been acquired, or having been acquired, the property is
left in possession of the debtor. This section does not alter the former law as
to what is and what is not a levy, it only relates to the period when the lien
of the execution attaches. Sawyer v. Bray, 102-79. Levy not necessary. —A sale
of real estate under an execution issued on a judgment which is a Hen thereon
is valid without a levy. Farrior v. Houston, 100-369. Against property in hands
of personal representative. (2) If it be against real or personal property in
the hands of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of
real property, or trustees, it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment
out of such property. After death of judgment debtor.—Under an execution tested
prior to the death of a testator (or intestate), though issued after the death,
the sheriff may proceed to sell the property. Aycock v. Harrison, 65-S; Grant
v. Newsom, 81-36; Halso v. Cole, 82-161. Contra. —Williams v. Weaver, 94-134,
and Sawyers v. Sawyers, 93-321, hold that an execution issued after death of
judgment debtor is void. See 'i 440, ante, and cases cited. Against the person.
(3) If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it shall require the
officer to arrest such debtor and commit him to the jail of the county until
he shall pay the judg ment or be discharged according to law. Execution against
person. —Such execution should command the sheriff to arrest the defendant and
commit him to the jail of the county from which it issued until he shall pay
the judgment or be discharged accord ing to law. Kinney v. Laughenour, 97-325.
See 'i 447, ante, and cases cited. For delivery of specific property. (4)
If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it
shall require the officer to deliver the possession of the same, particularly
describing it, to the party entitled thereto, and may at the same time require
the officer to satisfy any costs, damages, rents or profits recovered by the
same judgment out of the personal prop erty of the party against whom it was
rendered, and the value of the property for which the judgment was recov ered,
to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be had, and if sufficient
personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property belonging to
him on the day when the judgment was docketed, or at any time thereafter, and
shall, in that respect, be deemed an execution against property. Recovery of
real estate. —It is the modern practice, under a writ of pos session, for the
plaintifff to point out to the sheriff, at his peril, the land recovered, and
the sheriff puts him in accordingly. Johnson v. Nevill, 65-677. , Damages are
recoverable up to the time of trial in an action of eject ment. Whisenhunt v.
Jones, 78-361. If the jury find the plaintifff is entitled to the land, but do
not find any wrongful act done to it by the defendant, the plaintifff cannot
recover damages or costs. Clarke v. Wagoner, 78-367. Writ of assistance. —A writ
of assistance is in the nature of an equitable habere facias possessionem, and
only issues out of courts of equity when land has been sold under a decree and
the terre-tenant refuses to give possession to the purchaser. The writ is never
granted except when the case is clear and notice has been given to the person in
possession of the land. All that is required to obtain the writ as against the
parties, and those claiming under them by conveyance made pendente lite, is to
show a presentation of the deed, and a demand for the possession, and a refusal.
The demand for possession is in all cases necessary, but the presentation of
the deed may be waived by the conduct of the person in possession. Knight v.
Houghtaling, 94-408. Notice of motion, however, is not necessary when the writ
was granted in open court without objection from counsel of defendant who were
present, and at the same term at which final judgment was rendered. Coor v.
Smith, 107-430.
