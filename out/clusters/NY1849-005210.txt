"That all dividends heretofore declared, or which shall hereafter be declared
by any corporation, company or association, whether char tered or not, which
shall not be recovered or claimed by suit by the par ties entitled thereto,
for five years after the same were or shall be declared, shall be paid by the
corporation, etc., to the trustees of the University," are in conflict with art.

the constitution, is synonymous with "distribu tive shares," and is used as a
convertible term meaning the same thing, viz: "dividends or distributive shares
of the estates of deceased per sons." University v. Railroad, 76-103. NoTE. —
This section of the constitution has since been materially changed. See, for
former practice in quo warranto, Battle's Digest, vol. 2, pp. 902, 909.
