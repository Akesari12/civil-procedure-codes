3221. Enforcement of certain judgments in favor of working women. In an
action brought in either of those courts, by a female, to recover for services
performed by her, if the plaintifff recovers a judgment for a sum not exceeding
fifty dollars, exclusive of costs, no property of the defendant is exempt from
levy and sale, by virtue of an execution against property issued thereupon ;
and, if such an execution is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied, the clerk
must, upon the application of the plaintifff, issue an execution against
the person of the defendant, for the sum remaining uncollected. A defendant,
arrested by virtue of an execution so issued against his person, must be
actually confined in the jail, and is not entitled to the liberties thereof ;
but he must be discharged, after having been so confined fifteen days. After his
discharge, an execution against his person cannot be issued upon the judgment,
but the judgment creditor may enforce the judgment against property, as if
the execution, from which the judgment debtor is discharged, has been returned
without his being taken.
