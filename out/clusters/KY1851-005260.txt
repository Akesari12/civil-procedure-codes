defense to the action, 1 W. L. M. 278, 282. A finding on the merits on the
final trial in favor of the party againstwhom the irregularity was committed
is a sufficient com pliance with this section, 25 O. S. 652. The section does

the court had no jurisdiction over the person of the de fendant, 9 O. S. 506,
510. It was not intended to deprive the parties of their right to a jury trial
under 5359, 5360 ; and it is error in the court after deciding that there is a
good ground to vacate to proceed to " try and decide " upon the validity of the
defense in a case where the parties have a right to a trial by jury and do not
waive that right, 24 O. S. 625 ; 25 O. S. 340.
