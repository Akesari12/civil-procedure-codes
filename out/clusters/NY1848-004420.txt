party, but the court now has power, on motion and due notice, to require the

to require the production of documents and private writings containing evidence
pertinent to the issue. McLeod v. Bullard, 84-515. The court has the power, by
virtue of 2? 578 and 1373 of The Code, to order the production of proper papers,

discovery is necessary to enable the plaintifff to state with accuracy the facts
upon which his case is founded. Justice v. Bank, 83-8. Answer to rule to produce
papers. —Where a rule has been served on a party to produce a certain letter,
an affidavit of the party that he had not seen the letter since he sent it—that
he had not knowingly destroyed it—and had made diligent search and could not
find it—is a sufficient answer to warrant a discharge of the rule. Fuller v.
McMillan, Paper must be produced, or absence accounted for. —A negotiable instru
ment, the execution of which is admitted in the answer, must be pro duced on
the trial or accounted for. Morrow v. Allman, 65-508. Contents of paper proved
by parol, when.—The contents of a paper-writing cannot be proved by parol,
unless notice has been given to the adverse party, who has it in possession, to
produce it on the trial. And this is so, notwithstanding such paper-writing is
a will proven and recorded according to law, but the record of which has been
destroyed by the burning of the court-house where it was deposited. Murchison
v. McLeod, 47-239. Appeal from order discharging rule to produce papers.—The
supreme court will not pass upon the propriety of an order discharging a rule
for the production of papers, unless the facts are stated, by the court below,
upon which the application is based. An affidavit filed in the court below is
not such statement, but is only evidence offered to enable that court to find
the facts. Maxwell v. McDowell, 50-391. Where party fails to avail himself of
this section.—When the court found as a fact that the defendant executor for
eleven years resisted payment of the debts sued on, because he doubted the
genuineness of the acknowledgment or new promise, set up by the plaintifff in
reply to defendant's plea of statute of limitations, as the defendant might have
had an inspection of the paper containing such alleged promise, there was an
unreasonable delay of payment, and the defendant was liable for costs. Long v.
Oxford, 104-408. See, also, The Code, ? 1373.
