are but a. means to accomplish the ends of justice: Pickett v. Wallace, 54
Cal. 147. Should they deprive a party of a statutory right they are void: P
v. 1l{cClellan, 3 Id. 101. Under this section every court has power to scribe
rules for orderly conduct 0 its business, not repugnant to law, and such rules
may be changed or modiﬁed; but while they are in force, unless so provided in
them, courts must up ly them to all cases’, and cannot ma e them a plicable in
their discretion: Coyote . S. M. Co. McCu¢, 43 Cal. 178, it is held that the
courts and suitors are alike bound by the rules, which should receive the same
construction as statutes. And it is said that parties have no un qualiﬁed right
to stipulate for the abrogation of rules of court: Rey nolds v. Lawrence, 15 Id.
359. But it is held that the court itself always has the power to suspend its
own rules or except a particular case from their operation whenever the purposes
of justice require it: Peqak v. Wil liams, 32 Id. 280; Pickett v. Wallace, 54
Id. 147; United States v. Brcilling, v. Ruble, 9 Or. 121; and in Ha-neon v. 20
