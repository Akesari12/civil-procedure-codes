56. 5057. Forms and rules of pleading. The forms of pleading in civil actions in
courts of record, and the rules by which their sufficiency shall be determined,
are those prescribed in this chapter. [51 v. 57, § 83 ; S. & C. 968.] 4971.
Pleading must be construed as meaning what is generally understood by ordinary
language and hence there can be no established technical mode of stating a cause
of action or defense, 8 O. S. 295. The rule of the common law that pleadings are
to be construed most strongly against the pleader is abro gated, 14 O. S. 417,
422. That construction will not be given to a pleading which will make it a vain
effort to establish the law bv averment or to aver a conclusion contrary to law,
22 O. S. 159, 170. When the facts set out in the petition entitle the plaintifff
to judgment it is immaterial what the form of the action would have been at law,
21 O. S. 596, 603. The meaning of the pleader must be fairly ascertained from
the whole instrument without regard to technical rules. If legal or technical
words are used they are to be taken in their recognized sense unless the context
shows another sense was intended, 42 O. S. 625. Pleadings must be fairly and
reasonably and not strictly construed, 43 O. S. 78. All parts must be construed
together, 16 O. S. 118.
