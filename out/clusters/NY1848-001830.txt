up payment and laches as defenses, it is demurrable when the facts set forth as
proof thereof are insufficient to determine the de fenses. —Mobley v. Cureton, 6
S. C, 49. An objection that the answer is not responsive to the complaint cannot
be taken under the Code.—Zimmerman v. Amaker, 10 S. C, 98.
