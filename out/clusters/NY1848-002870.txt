real property, the jury, in their discretion, may render a general or special
verdict. In all other cases the Court may direct the jury to find a special
verdict in writing upon any or all of the issues ; and in all cases may instruct
them, if they render a general ver dict, to find upon particular questions of
fact, to be stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The
special verdict or finding shall be filed with the Clerk and entered upon the
minutes. Where plaintifff takes possession of the property, a verdict in the
words " We find for the defendant the return of the property or $507.95," is
in com pliance with this Section.— Bardin v. Drafts, 10 S. C, 493. But where
the action is to recover "patterns" in foundry proved to be worth $5,000,
and the Judge charged that defendants were entitled to a part thereof, the
verdict in these words, " We find the plaintifff patterns the value of $100,"
does not identify the property, and is void.— Eason v. Kelly, 18 S. C, 881.
In such action a verdict which calls for a delivery or return of the property
is insufficient and illegal, unless it assess the value of the property, even
though there be no testimony as to value. The Section is mandatory.— Eason v.
Kelly, 18 S. C, 381 ; Thompson v. Lee, 19 S. C, 489 ; Lockhart v. Little, 30 S.
