5133. Judgment on default. When entered. In an action upon an account, or
written instrument for the payment of money only, or in foreclosure, judgment
may be entered at any time during the term after the defendant is in default
for an answer ; but the court may, for good cause shown, give further time for
answer. [66 v. 42 ; 1 307.] See S5320 as to how damages assessed upon default.
In an action for the recovery of money only, it is error to take judg ment by
default against a defendant, the summons against whom has no indorsement upon
it of the amount claimed, and whose appearance to the action is not otherwise
affected, 25 O. 6. 82. Where judgment is rendered on default in an action ou
an account without proof of the plaintifff's claim, there is no error for which
judgment will be reversed, the requiring of such proof on failure to answer
being a matter within the dis cretion of the court, 25 O. S. 635. See 3 C. C.
144.
