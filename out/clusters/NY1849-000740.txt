defendant shall neither answer or demur, the plaintifff shall have judgment for
the sum sued for, as in the case of liquidated demands. In all other cases where
the defend ant fails to appear and answer, the plaintifff cannot recover with
out proving his case. The last clause applies to cases by default.—Barron v.
Dent, 17 S. C, 75. And the fact of indorsements upon the summons that there was
a hearing and examination of witnesses is not sufficient to show that defendant
appeared and defended.—lb. Not can such showing be made by parol testimony.—
lb. 9. In an action or defense founded upon an account, or an instrument for
the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient for a party to deliver the
account or instrument to the Court, and to state that there is due to him
thereon, from the adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims to recover
or set off. Does not nullify last clause of preceding subdivisions ; does not
apply to case of default.—Barron v. Dent, 17 S. C, 75. 10. A variance between
the proof on the trial and the allega tions in a pleading shall be disregarded,
as immaterial, unless the Court shall be satisfied that the adverse party has
been misled to his prejudice thereby. 11. The pleadings may be amended at any
time before the trial, or during the trial, or upon appeal, when, by such amend
ment, substantial justice will be promoted. If the amendment be made after the
joining of the issue, and it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the Court,
by oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse party in consequence
of such amend ment, an adjournment shall be granted. The Court may also, in its
discretion, require, as a condition of an amendment, the payment of costs to
the adverse party. 1837, xix., s3.\ 12. Execution may be issued on a judgment
heretofore or hereafter rendered in Trial Justices' Courts at any time after
the rendering of such judgment, and within three years after the rendition
thereof, and shall be returnable sixty days from date of the same, but no
sale thereunder shall be made until after the time for appealing has expired,
nor pending such appeal : Pro vided, That in cases for the claim and delivery
of personal prop erty where bond for the property claimed has been properly
given by either party, the status of such property shall not be changed until
after the expiration of time for appealing has expired, or until such appeal
has terminated. In issuing execution Trial Justice acts judicially and is not
liable in damages therefore unless it was done willfully and corruptly.—McCall
v. Cohen, 16 S. C, 445 ; Abrams v. Carlisle, 18 S. C, 242. Can Trial Justice
issue execution within the five days allowed for motion for new trial ?- Abram
$ v. Carlisle, 18 S. C, 242. 13. If the judgment be docketed with the Clerk
of the Circuit Court, the execution shall be issued by him to the Sheriff of
the County, and have the same effect, and be executed in the same manner, as
other executions and judgments of the Circuit Court. Referred to.—Lawrence v.
Isear, 27 S. C, 244. Such execution may be tested by the Clerk of said Court.
—Bragg v. Thomp son, 19 S. C, 572. 14. The Court may, at the joining of the
issue, require either party, at the request of the other, at that or some other
specified time, to exhibit his account, or state the nature thereof as far
as may be in his power, and, in case of his default, preclude him from giving
evidence of such parts thereof as shall not have been so exhibited or stated.
15. The provisions of this Code of Procedure, respecting forms of actions,
parties to actions, the rules of evidence, the times of commencing actions,
and the service of process upon corpora tions, shall apply to these Courts.
The defendant may, on the return of process, and before answering, make an
offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken against him for an amount, to
be stated in such offer, with costs. The plaintifff shall thereupon, and before
any other proceedings shall be had in the action, determine whether he will
accept or reject such offer. If he accept the offer, and give notice thereof, in
writing, the Trial Justice shall file the offer and the accept ance thereof, and
render judgment accordingly. If notice of acceptance be not given, and if the
plaintifff fail to obtain judg ment for a greater amount, exclusive of costs,
than has been specified in the offer, he shall not recover costs, but shall
pay to the defendant his costs accruing subsequent to the offer. It is error in
Trial Justice to refuse to allow defendant's counsel to crossexamine generally
plaintifff's witness.—Dillard v. Samuels, 25 S. C, 318. Plaintiff is liable for
all costs of the case, subsequent to defendant's offer, if he refuse to accept
it, and recover less.— Williford v. Gadsden, 27 S. C, 87. 16. Where twentv-
five or more dollars is demanded, the com1873 XV 869* * 1S91, xx.," ins! plaint
shall be served on the defendant twenty days, and where less than that sum is
demanded, five days, before the day therein fixed for trial : Provided, That
if the plaintifff shall make out that he is apprehensive of losing his debt by
such delay, and the Trial Justice considers that there is good reason therefore
(the ground of such apprehension being set forth in an affidavit, and served
with a copy of the complaint), he may make such process returnable in such time
as the justice of the case may require. Defendant may waive the twenty days'
notice ; and if he goes to trial on less notice, without objection, he is bound
by the judgment.—Benson v. Carrier. 28 S. C, 119. As to the proviso, applied.—
Cavender v. Ward, 28 S. C, 470. ib7u xvi co !*• Any Trial Justice Court of this
State shall have power to grant a new trial in any case tried in the said Court
for reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in the Courts of law
of this State ; but the case tried shall only be heard and tried anew by the
Trial Justice before whom the case was first tried. A motion for a new trial is
not required as a condition precedent to an ap peal.— Minnick v. Fort, 1S S. C,
215. He cannot so relieve against his own judgments on grounds of mistake, in
advertence, surprise or neglect ; that can only be done by appeal. —lb. So as to
judgments by default, that may be satisfactorily excused. —Lawrence v. hear, 27
S. C, 244. New trial will not be granted where irrelevant testimony is received
against objection, which could not have affected the verdict. — Riggs v. Wilson,
SO S. C, 172. Appeal lies to the Circuit Court from an order granting a new
trial. —liedfearn v. Douglass, 35 S. C, 569. iu. 18. No motion for a new trial
shall be heard unless made within five days from the rendering of the judgment ;
but the right of appeal from the judgment shall exist for five days after the
refusal of a motion for a new trial. Trial Justice cannot hear such motion
unless made within the five days.— Doty v. Duvall, 19 S. C, 143. 1887, XIX.,
787. 19. Whenever either party to a civil action which is to be tried before a
Trial Justice shall file with the Trial Justice issuing the papers an affidavit
to the effect that he does not believe he can obtain a fair trial before the
Trial Justice, the papers shall be turned over to the nearest Trial Justice of
the County, who shall proceed to try the case as if he had issued the papers :
Provided, Such affidavit shall set forth the grounds of such belief, that two
days' notice of the application for such transfer shall be given to the adverse
party, and that but one such transfer shall be allowed each party in any case.
This provision shall not apply to trials before the Judicial Trial Justice of
the city of Charleston.
