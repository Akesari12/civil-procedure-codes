return thereof, upon giving to '" the Sheriff a written undertaking, executed
by two or more suffi cient sureties, to the effect that they are bound in double
the value of the property, as stated in the affidavit of the plaintifff, for
the delivery thereof to the plaintifff, if such delivery be adjudged, and for
the payment to him of such sum as may for any cause be recovered against the
defendant. If a return of the property be not so required within three days
after the taking and service of notice to the defendant, it shall be delivered
to the plaintifff, except as provided in Section 237. Judgment having been
rendered in the action in favor of plaintifff for dam ages, and not for delivery
of the property, it was sufficient proof of breach of the bond given by the
defendant under this Section in suit thereon.— Thomp son v. Joplin, 12 S. C,
580. The words " if such delivery be adjudged " mean adjudged by any competent
authority.—Elder v. Green, 34 S. C, 154.
