5419. How judgment against principal and surety entered. When judgment is
rendered in a court of rec ord within this state, upon an instrument of writing
in which two or more persons are jointly or severally bound, and it is made
to appear to the court, by parol or other testimony, that one or more of
the persons so bound signed the same as surety or bail for his or their co-
defendant, the clerk of such court, in recording the judgment thereon, shall
certify which of the defendants is principal debtor, and which surety or bail;
the clerk shall issue execution on such judgment, commanding the officer to
cause the money to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements,
of the principal debtor, or, for want of sufficient property of the principal
debtor to make the same, that he cause the same to be made of the goods and
chattels, lands and tenements, of the surety or bail ; and the property, both
personal and real, of the principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the
court, shall be exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail
shall be taken in execution. [51 v. 57, H49; S. & C. 1083.] The consent of
parties to a judgment in open court at the time it is rendered, that one or
more of the defendants may be certified as sureties, is sufficient, 36 O. S.
155. The omission to make the certificate, 11O. 310, or refusal of the court
to make it, 3 Bull 547 (but see obiter 11 O. 310), can not be corrected by a
proceeding in error. If sureties neglect, when judgment is ren dered, to cause
the entry to be made, chancery will not compel the judgment creditor to first
exhaust the property of the prin cipal, 16 O. 27. Yet if, with a knowledge of
the suretyship, the judgment creditor levies upon unincumbered land of the prin
cipal debtor, and afterwards abandons the levy without theconsent of the surety,
the surety will be discharged to the extent of the vulue of the land released
from the levy, 40 O. S. 446. Such finding by the court and certificate in the
judgment showing who are principals and who are sureties do not conclude the
parties in a subsequent action for contribution ; and the effect of such finding
and certificate is not changed by the fact that the defendants appeared at the
trial and filed answers, in which each alleged that the others were principal
debtors, 25 O. S. 89. Where the holder of a joint and several obligation elects
to sue one of the obligors who is only a surety thereon, it is not com petent
for the defendant, by cross-petition or otherwise, to bring in his principal for
the purpose of having the relation of princi pal and surety certified under this
section, although the holder knew that such relation existed, 31 O. S. 565.

holder Knew that such relation existed, 31 O. S. 665. Refusal of court to grant
motion of defendant asking that it be certified that one of the defendants was
principal and the other surety, is not sub ject to review on error, 3 Bull 547.
