to the pay­ ment of the costs of "the court and expenses of the sale, and the
amount due to the plaintifff'; and if it appear from the sheriff's return that
the proceeds are insufficient, and a balance still remains due, judgment shall
then be docketed for such balance against the defendant or defendants per­
sonally liable for the debt, and shall then become a lien on the real estate
of such judgment debtor as in other cases on which execution may be issued.

mort­ gaged, or having a lien thereon, which conveyance or lien docs not appear

proceedings therein had shall be as conclusive against the party holding such
unrecorded conveyance or lien iis if he had been made a party to said action,
and shall in all respects have the same force and effect.
