50, acts 1885) requiring the bond to cover the damages and interest, as well as

undertaking. Amendment. —The effect of the amendment is to make the condition
of the bond therein provided for harmonious with the judgment authorized
by the law regulating proceedings in claim and delivery, Hall v. Till man,
103-276. Sureties liable. —When, in claim and delivery, the parties compromise
and agree upon a judgment for a definite sum and costs in lien of an order
of restitution, such judgment is binding on the sureties to the plaintifff's
undertaking. Council v. Averett, 90-168. Sureties not liable. —The sureties
to an undertaking, on behalf of the defendant, in claim and delivery, are not
liable for any debt which plain tiff may recover in the action. Hall v. Tillman,
103-276. Improper bond taken, sheriff liable. —Where, in claim and delivery,
the sheriff returned to the defendant the property and only took from him a
bond to indemnify the sheriff, and not such a bond as this section requires, it
is a breach of the sheriff's official bond, which renders him and his sureties
liable at once to an action by the plaintifff. Hughes v. Newsom, 86-424.
Property disposed of by defendant after suit brought.—Where it is in evi dence,
in an action of claim and delivery, that the defendant has, since suit brought,
disposed of the property, the plaintifff can recover the value of the property
at the time of the demand. Miller v. Hahn, 84-226.
