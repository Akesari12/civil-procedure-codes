proceedings without notice.— Dilling v. Foster, 21 S. C, 838. Although another
Judge upon application of other creditors had previously refused to do so.—
Dauntless Co. v. Davis, 22 S. C, 584. And notwithstanding creditors' action
in another Court and a previous assignment by debtor.—lb. But there can be
only one Receiver so appointed. —Sparks v. Davis, 25 S. C, 381. Receiver
may be appointed at chambers.—Kilgore v. Hair, 19 S. C, 486 ; Regenstein v.
Pearlstein, 30 S. C, 192 ; Harmon v. Wagener, 33 S. C, 487. But the power is
a delicate one and must be exercised with great care. — Pelzer v. Hughes, 27
S. C , 408. The Master of the Court cannot be appointed Receiver.—Kilgore v.
Hair, 19 S. C, 48B. Admissions in answer are sufficient evidence on motion for
appointment of Receiver.—Meinhard v. Strickland, 29 S. C, 491. Where President

appointed to take charge of the assigned estate, where they have not exhausted
their legal remedies, nor show danger of loss of property or injury thereto. —

incompetency on the part of the assignee, satisfactory to the Judge, he was
justified in appointing a Receiver. —Regenstein v. Pearlstein, 30 S. C, 192.

misconduct, and that he and estate were insolvent, creditors could, without
ex hausting their legal remedies, have Receiver appointed.—Harmon v. Wagener,
33 S. C, 4S7. Unless mortgagee establishes an apparent right or claim to the
assets and profits, he is not entitled to have a Receiver thereof appointed
in his action for foreclosure.—Hardin v. Hardin, 34 S. C, 77. Even though the

to collect rents in pending action.—DeWalt v. Kinard, 19 S. C, 293. Nor is
bond essential for Receiver appointed in supple mentary proceedings.—Dilling
