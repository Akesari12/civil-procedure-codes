attachment is only a legal deposit in the hands of the sheriff to abide the
event of the action, and when judgment is rendered and execution comes to the
sheriff's hands his power to hold is merged into the larger powers acquired
by him under the execution. Gamble v. Rhyne, 80-183. The personal property
exemption cannot be sold under process of attachment. Com'rs v. Riley, 75-144;
Gamble v. Rhyne, 80-183. Judgment set aside, when. —When a judgment has been
obtained in an attachment against a corporation, sued by a wrong name, upon a
fraudu lent demand, and having no notice of the action, such judgment should be
set aside, and the company allowed to plead, although the same was known by one
name as well as another. Deep River Copper Co. v. Mar tin, 70-300.
