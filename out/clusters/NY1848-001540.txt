229. Jurisdiction, appearance, not lie of lis pendens. C. C. P., s. 90. From
the time of the service of the summons in a civil action, or the allowance
of a provisional remedy, the court is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction,
and to have con trol of all subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appear ance
of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him. In
an action affecting the title to real property, the plaintifff, at the time
of filing the complaint, or at any time afterwards, or whenever a warrant of
attach ment shall be issued, or at any time afterwards, the plain tiff, or
a defendant when he sets up an affirmative cause of action in his answer and
demands substantive relief, at the time of filing his answer, or at any time
afterwards, if the same be intended to affect real estate, may file with the
clerk of each county in which the property is situated, a notice of the pendency
of the action, containing the names of the parties, the object of the action,
and the description of the property in that county affected thereby; and if the
action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage, such notice must be filed twenty
days before judgment, and must contain the date of the mortgage, the parties
thereto, and the time and place of registering the same. From the time of filing
only, shall the pendency of the action be constructive notice to a purchaser or
encumbrancer of the property affected thereby; and every person whose conveyance
or encumbrance is sub: sequently executed or subsequently registered shall
be deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, and shall be bound by all
proceedings taken after the filing of such notice, to the same extent as if
he were made a party to the action. For the purposes of this section an action
shall be deemed to be pending from the time of filing such notice: Provided,
that such notice shall be of no avail unless it shall be followed by the first
publication of notice of the summons, or by an order therefore, or by the
personal ser vice on the defendant within sixty days after such filing. And the
court in which the said action was commenced may, in its discretion, at any time
after the action shall be settled, discontinued or abated, on application of
any per son aggrieved, and on good cause shown, and on such notice as shall be
directed or approved by the court, order the notice authorized by this section
to be canceled of record by the clerk of any county in whose office the same
may have been filed or recorded ; and such cancelation shall be made by an
indorsement to that effect on the margin of the record, which shall refer to
the order, and for which the clerk shall be entitled to a fee of twenty-five
cents. Voluntary appearance. —A voluntary appearance is equivalent to service
of summons. Bank v. Wilson, 80-200; Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21 ; Middleton v. Duffy,
73-72 ; Moore v. Railroad, 67-209. But does not supply the place of summons not
actually issued. Etheridge v. Woodley, 83-11; contra, Heilig v. Stokes, 63-612;
Moore v. Railroad, 67-209 ; Hervey v. Edmunds, 68-243 ; Middleton v. Duffy,
7372 ; Slate v. Jones, 88-683. A general appearance waives all defects in the
summons. Jones v. Penland, 18-358; Hyatt v. Totnlin, 24-149; Duffy v. Averitt,
27-455; Wheeler v. Cobb, 75-21. Notice of all proceedings. —A defendant upon
whom a summons is served is fixed with notice of all subsequent orders in the
cause. Sparrow v. Davidson, 77-35 ; University v. Lassiter, 83-38. Lis pendens,
when applicable. —Lis pendens does not generally apply in proceedings to obtain
alimony, but will in certain instances, as in this case, where the land in
question was all the property the defendant pos sessed. Daniel v. Hodges, 87-95.
Lis pendens applies where there was a motion to issue a ven. ex., and the land
was aliened pending the motion. Isler v. Brown, 66-556. Also, where there was
a proceeding to subject equitable property to the payment of a judgment. Tabb
v. Williams, 57-352. Also, where the land was the subject of a suit in equity
at the time of its alienation. Baird v. Baird, 62-317. Lis pendens, when not
necessary.—A lis pendens is not necessary to bind a purchaser with notice, who
buys land at an execution sale in the county where the litigation was pending.
Rollins v Henry, 78-352. If property is transferred by the defendant pending
a suit involving its title, in which there is afterwards a judgment for the
plaintifff, the judgment relates to the begining of the action, and binds the
property in the hands of the purchaser, and when the transaction and suit are
in the same county and the record furnishes evidence of the claim, this rule
is not affected by the provisions of this section. Dancy v. Duncan, 96-m.
Strangers to an action are not affected with constructive notice of an action
involving the title to lands situate in a county other than that in which the
action is pending, unless the notice lis pendens is given under this section ;
but even purchasers for value, although not parties, are affected by such notice
if the lands are in the county where the action is pending and the pleadings
describe them with reasonable cer tainty. Spencer v. Credle, 102-68. Where the
lands are situated in the county where the action is pend ing and the pleadings
sufficiently indicate the property and the charac ter of the litigation, that
is a substantial compliance with this section. • Collingwood v. Brown, 106-362.
Lis pendens notice to all the world.—A lispendens filed only in the county where
litigation is pending is yet notice, constructively, in every county in the
state from the date of the filing. Todd v. Outlaw, 79-235. Before the C. C. P.
the pendency of an action for land was notice to all the world. Baird v. Baird,
62-217. This section is a substitute for the common law lis pendens and must
be filed in every county where the property is situated, other than the county
in which the action is brought. Collingwood v. Brown, 106-362. Property must be
specifically described.—A party to an action desiring to claim the protection
of a notice by lis pendens must describe the prop erty specifically in his
pleadings. Badger v. Daniel, 77-251 ; Todd v. Outlaw, 79-235. Lis pendens by
a third party.—One who is refused leave to be made a party to the action can
protect his interest in the subject-matter of the controversy by filing a lis
pendens in each county where the land lies and instituting proceedings. Toms v.
Warson, 66-417.

SC1893-001570

7, Part 2, of this Code of Procedure, shall be issued, or at any time
afterwards, the plaintifff, or a defendant, when he sets up an affirmative cause
of action in his answer, and demands substantive relief, at the time of filing
his answer, or at any time afterwards, if the same be intended to affect real
estate, may file with the Clerk of each County in which the property is situated
a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties,
the object of the action, and the descrip tion of the property in that County
affected thereby ; and if the action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage, such
notice must be filed twenty days before judgment, and must contain the date of
the mortgage, the parties thereto, and the time and place of recording the same.
From the time of filing only shall the pen dency of the action be constructive
notice to a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby ; and
every per son whose conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently executed or
subsequently recorded shall be deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer,
and shall be bound by all proceedings taken after the filing of such notice to
the same extent as if he were made a party to the action. For the purposes of
this Section, an action shall be deemed to be pending from the time of filing
such notice ; but such notice shall be of no avail unless it shall be fol
lowed by the first publication of the summons, or an order there for, or by the
personal service thereof on a defendant within sixty days after such filing.
And the Court in which the said action was commenced may, in its discretion,
at any time after the action shall be settled, discontinued or abated, as is
provided in Section 142, on application of any person aggrieved, and on good
cause shown, and on such notice as shall be directed or approved by the Court,
order the uotice authorized by this Section to be can celled of record by the
Clerk of any County in whose office the same may have been filed or recorded ;
and such cancellation shall be made by an endorsement to that effect on the
margin of the record, which shall refer to the order, and for which the Clerk
shall be entitled to a fee of twenty-five cents. Sale of laud under execution
levied, before lis pendens was filed in action to foreclose mortgage on it, gave
good title to purchaser ; and he had right as a proper party, by petition in the
action, to contest the mortgage.—Ex Parte Mobley, 19 S. C, 337. summons, by

in which an attachment is not made on mesne process, or his attorney, at the
time the action is commenced, or afterwards, or a defendant, when he sets up an

names of the parties, the nature and object of the action, the court to which
it is returnable, and the term, session, or return day thereof, the date of the
process, and the description of the property in such town affected thereby. From
the time of the recording only, shall the pendency of the action be notice to a
purchaser or encumbrancer of the property ; and every person whose conveyance or
encumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently recorded shall be deemed to
be a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, and shall be bound by all proceedings
taken after the recording of such notice, to the same extent as if he were made
a party to the action. For the purpose of this section an action shall be deemed
to be pending from the time of the recording of such notice; provided, however,
that such notice shall bo of no avail unless service of the process shall be
completed within the time provided by law.
