division of the complaint, in such manner that each division alone might be the
subject of an independent action.—lb. ; Hammond v. R. ti., 15 S. C, 10. Such
failure to so state each cause of action separately is a vice in pleading, but
only to be remedied by motion to make more definite and cer tain.—Hellams v.
Switzer, 24 S. C, 89. Action against administrators, their sureties and personal
representatives, for account and settlement of the estate of intestate, which
made a party de fendant, who was alleged to claim the land of the intestate,

A bill seeking settlement of all matters growing out of an estate is not mul
