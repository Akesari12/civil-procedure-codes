enter up judgment, he can not of right file a second motion, although the three

motion after verdict and before entry of judgment is sufficient compliance with
statute, 5 O. S. 288. That the judg ment was rendered near the close of the
term, does not give to the losing party the right to file a motion for a new
trial after the term has ended, although it was filed within three days after
the rendition of the judgment and before it was actually entered on the journal,
3 C. C. 581. If the losing party files the motion after the term has closed,
it will not justify the clerk in refusing to issue an execution on the judgment
upon a proper demand therefore, Id. When a motion for a new trial, for errors of
law occurring at the trial, is continued to a subsequent term, the overruling of
such motion is not assignable as error, unless such errors were excepted to at

(1887). A motion for a new trial on the iground of newly discovered evidence
must be made at the trial term. After such term, the applica tion must be made
under §5309, Id. When not required, IOC. O. 395.
