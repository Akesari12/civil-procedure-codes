action for specific performance of contract for sale of land, defendant set up a
rescission of contract by agreement, and plaintifff admitted the agreement, but
alleged that the same was made on condition that defendant was to pay a sum of
money, which had not been paid, and demanded judgment for the amount; defendant
demurred for that the plaintifff's reply was not consistent with the complaint:
Held, that there was error in refusing to overrule the demurrer, since neither
the alleged unperformed condition of rescission nor the money demanded is
inconsistent with the pleading. Houston v. Sledge, 98-414. If an answer or reply
is insufficient, the opposite party may move for judgment, and if the motion is
refused he can have his exception noted. If he fails to do this, the objection
is usually waived. Walker v. Scott,
