554. On judgment for money, security to stay execu tion; new undertaking, on
sureties becoming insolvent; perishable property may be sold. C. C. 1'., ss.
304, 311. If the appeal be from a judgment directing the payment of money, it
shall not stay the execution of the judgment, unless a written undertaking be
executed on the part of the appellant, by one or more sureties, to the effect
that if the judgment appealed from, or any part thereof, be affirmed, or the
appeal be dismissed, the appellant will pay the amount directed to be paid
by the judgment, or the part of such amount as to which the judgment shall be
affirmed, if it be affirmed only in part, and all damages which shall be awarded
against the appellant upon the appeal. Whenever it shall be satisfactorily made
to appear to the court that since the execution of the undertaking the sureties
have become insolvent, the court may, by rule or order, require the appellant
to execute, file and serve a new undertaking, as above; and in case of neglect
to exe cute such undertaking within twenty days after the service of a copy of
the rule or order requiring such new under taking, the appeal may, on motion to
the court, be dis missed with costs. Whenever it shall be necessary for a party
to any action or proceeding to give a bond or an undertaking, with surety or
sureties, he may, in lieu thereof, deposit with the officer or in court as the
case may require, money to the amount for which such bond or undertaking is to
be given. The court in which such action or proceeding is pending may direct
what disposi tion shall be made of such money pending the action or proceeding.
In any case where, by this section, the money is to be deposited with an
officer, a judge of the court, at any time, upon the application of either
party, may, before such deposit is made, order it to be deposited in court
instead of with such officer; and a deposit made, pursuant to such order, shall
be of the same effect as if made with such officer. The perfecting of an appeal
by giving the undertaking mentioned in this section, shall stay proceedings
in the court below upon the judgment appealed- from; except when the sale of
perishable property is directed, the court below may order the property to be
sold and the proceeds thereof to be deposited or invested, to abide the judgment
of the appellate court. Undertaking filed, for costs only.—Where the plaintifff,
in a suit for laud, at the spring term of the superior court of a county,
recovers judgment and the defendant appeals, but gives an undertaking for the
costs only, and at the next ensuing term of the supreme court in June, the judg
ment is affirmed, and then the plaintifff takes out a writ of possession from
the superior court, which is executed, he will be entitled to the crops growing
on the ground for that year. Cox v. Hamilton, 69-30. The appellee has the right
to issue execution when an undertaking to secure the costs of the appeal only
is given, instead of the deposit of money to bide the event of the appeal.
Bledsoe v. Nixon, 69-81. Contention whether or not the bond is for costs only.
—Where there was a contention as to whether the undertaking was intended for a
bond for costs only, or by mistake was written as a supersedeas bond, an issue
as to that was framed and sent down to be passed upon by a jury. Burnett v.
Nicholson, 86-728. Form of supersedeas bond. —No particular form is required for
an under taking to stay execution upon appeal, and if words are inserted in such
undertaking repugnant to its intent, they will be rejected as surplusage. Oakley
v. Van Noppen, 100-287. When two separate undertakings.— Where the undertaking
on appeal for the costs and the undertaking to stay execution are in one
instrument, the appellee, upon filing the proper proofs of the insolvency of the
surety, is entitled to have the appeal dismissed, as prescribed by this
