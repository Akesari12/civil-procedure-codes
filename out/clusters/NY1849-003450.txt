use of a creditor proceeding under this chapter. Sutton v. Askew, 66-172. The
superior courts have jurisdiction to hear and determine an action instituted
by a creditor of a lunatic, for the recovery of a debt contracted prior to
the lunacy. In such case, where the judge, in the court below, dismissed
proceedings supplementary to execution: Held, to be error. Blake v. Respass,
77-193. Supplemental proceedings lie against a private corporation chartered
by the legislature and organized for the private gain of its stockholders.
La Fontaine v. Southern Underwriters, 79-511. Agreement to deliver specific
articles at a price named, how subjected. — Where it appears from an examination
under supplemental proceedings that the judgment debtor holds a claim against
a third party, to be dis charged by the delivery of corn at a stipulated price
per bushel, the court cannot order such person to deliver to the creditor a
sufficient quantity of the corn, at the agreed price, to satisfy the debt.
The proper order is to sell the corn and apply the proceeds to the debt. In

If after supple mental proceedings instituted and proceedings aud a receiver

their behalf. Righton v. Pruden, 73-61. No lien on debtor's services. —While
creditors may subject, in a supple mental proceeding, the debtor's choses in

and cannot com pel him to exact compensation for managing his wife's property,
or for service rendered to any person with the understanding that it was gra
tuitous. Osborne v. Wilkes, 108-651.
