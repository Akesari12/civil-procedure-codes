418. Exceptions, how and when taken. C. C. P., s. 242. (1) For the purposes of
an appeal, either part}' may except to a decision on a matter of law arising
upon such trial within ten days after the judgment, in the same manner and with
the same effect as upon a trial by jury : Pro vided, that where the decision
does not authorize a final judgment, but directs further proceedings before
a referee or otherwise, either party may except thereto, and make a case or
exception as above provided in case of an appeal. (2) And either party desiring
a review, upon the evi dence appearing on the trial of the questions of law,
may at any time within ten days after the judgment, or within such time as
may be prescribed by the rules of the court, make a case or exceptions in
like manner as upon a trial by jury> except that the judge, in settling the
case must briefly specify the facts found by him, and his conclusions of law.
Exceptions must be distinctly set out.—Exceptions taken tnust be dis tinctly set
out, together with the facts upon which they depend. Meekins v. Tatem, 79-546;
Williamson v. Canal Co., 78-156. Too late to except. —After the filing of a
referee's report, it was agreed that the cause should be tried by the court,
without a jury, upon the evidence taken and returned by the referee, and it was
so tried and determined, the court adopting some of the referee's findings :
Held, that it was then too late to object that the referee had exceeded the
scope of his authority under the order of reference; nor could the objections
taken to the reception and rejection of evidence before the referee be insisted
upon, unless they had been made again on the hear ing before the court. Silver
Valley Co. v. Baltimore Smelting Co., 99-445The poii t that there is no evidence
to support the findings of fact made or adopted by the judge below, must be made
by exception filed and called to the attention of the judge during the term,
in analogy to a motion for a new trial. An exception based on such grounds,
filed after the term, under Rule 27, will not be considered in the supreme
court ; although the exception, that there is no evidence, elc., is one which
the court will pass upon if made in apt time. Battle v. Mayo, 102-413. Findings
on issues of fact.—The findings of fact by the judge, when he is authorized
by law or the consent of parties to pass upon them, is as conclusive as the
verdict of a jury upon issues submitted, if there be evidence ; if there be no
evidence, it is an error in law, open to correc tion in either case, to find
them. Branton v. O'Briant, 93-99. Where, in a suit instituted in the late court
of equity, and transferred to the superior court docket under the provisions of
the Code of Civil Pro cedure, the parties agreed that the judge should find the
facts, and that he should examine witnesses orally, and only the substance of
the oral evidence was sent up with the record, the right to have the findings
of fact reviewed by the supreme court is waived. Runnion v. Ramsay, 93-410.
Findings on questions of fact. —The findings of fact by the judge on ques tions
of fact in a cause of purely legal cognizance, are final, and not sub ject to
exceptions. Burke v. Turner, 85-500; Greensboro v. Scott, 84-184; McAden v.
Banister, 63-478. material fact not found.—Where the case is left by consent to
be tried, both as to the facts and the law by the judge, and he fails to find
some material tact, it will be remanded, in order that such may be found. Knott
v. Taylor, 96-553. Attention of bar called to this section by the court. —The
attention of the bar is called to this section by the court. Jacobs v. Burgwyn,
63-196. Officers not entitled to costs, when. —Officers neglecting these
provisions of The Code are not entitled to costs. Jacobs v. Burgwyn, 63-196;
Fourshee v. Pattershall, 67-453; Green v. Castleberry, 70-20.

decree in chancery rendered in vacation, it is not neces sary to serve the Judge
with a copy of the exceptions.— Godbold v. Vance, 14 & C, 458. Matters stated
only in the exceptions are not facts in the case.—Lites v. Ad dison, 27 a C,
