the parties, 31 O. S. 28; 35 O. S. 645. The judgment of reversal is effective
notwithstanding the death of plaintifff in error, and it is competent for the
court to which the cause is remanded for a new trial to order a revivor of the

S. 96. Where the district court dismisses a proceeding in error on the erroneous
ground" that the judgment complained of is not reviewable, the supreme court

dates from date of judgment reviewed and does not operate to divert right
acquired by the parties subse quent to that date, 1 C. C. 108. Upon the reversal
of judgment below in absence of anything to show what the evidence was, the
reviewing court will not render judgment that should have been rendered below,
but will remand for new trial, 12 Bull 100. Reversal of judgment of reversal
estops party obtaining it from impeaching the original judgment, 15 O. S. 478.
