the arrest of the defendants, who were non-residents. They being unable to give

to insolvent debtors : Held, they were entitled to the benefits of such statute.
Burgwyn v. Hall, 108-489. Applies to tortB as well as debts,—The benefits of
the statute extend as well to those arrested for torts as for debt, and the
