to the effect that the plaintifff in error will pay the condemnation money, and
costs, if the judgment or final order be affirmed, in whole or in part. 2. When
it directs the execution of a conveyance, or other instrument, the undertaking
shall be in such sum as may be prescribed by a court of record, or a judge
thereof, to the effect that plaintifff in error will abide the judgment, if the

of possession, of real property, the undertaking shall be in such sum as may
be prescribed by a court of record, or a judge thereof, to the effect that,
during the possession of such property by the plaintifff in error, he will

bond need only substantially conform to the statute, 1 O. 170. Where one of
several defendants against whom judgment had been rendered, prosecuted error
alone against the adverse party, and judgment was affirmed, it was held an
action could be sustained upon such bond, though there was a defect of parties
plaintifff in error, and a second petition in error by all the parties was
pending. 29 O. S. 620. A bond conditioned to prose cute writ of error to effect
and abide the judgment binds the obligors to pay the amount of the judgment, and
in the declara tion upon such bond it was not necessary to aver that the writ of
supersedeas was taken out by the plaintifff in error. 5 O. 169. Where the relief
desired during the pendency of the proceeding in error is an order to stay
further action in the proceedings which, by the original action, the plaintifff
seeks to enjoin, such relief should be sought under § 5578; 36 (). S. 316. 1.
In an action 'ui such undertaking, affirmance of judgment as to one defendant
forfeits the bond as to all, 3 Bull 11 ; 1 Clev. R. 89. The nature and extent
of the obligation should bealleged in the petition, showing the facts, amount,
and foundation of plaintifff's claim, ID. 161; see2C. C. R. 459 ; 3 Id. 484. 3.
Where the judgment is for the sale of mortgaged property, the undertaking should
provide against waste, and for the value of the use and occupation as well as
for payment of deficiency. 34 O. S. 671. Under this clause the common pleas or a
judge thereof may fix the amount of the undertaking for stay in that court while
the case is pending on error in the supreme court, 38 O. S. 658 ; see 3 C. C. R.
484.

of mortgaged premises and the payment of a deficiency arising from the sale,
the undertaking must also provide for the payment of such deficiency. 4. When
it directs the assignment or delivery of docu ments, they may be placed in the
custody of the clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered, to abide
the judgment of the reviewing court, or the undertaking shall be in such sum
as may be prescribed as aforesaid, to abide the judgment, and pay costs, if
the judgment be affirmed. [82 v. 37 ; 51 v. 57, § 519 ; S. & C. 1 104.] The
bond need only substantially conform to the statute, I O. 170. Where one of
several defendants against whom judgment had been rendered, prosecuted error
alone against the adverse party, and judgment was affirmed, it was held an
action could be sustained upon such bond, though there was a defect of par

should be al leged in the petition, showing the facts, amount, and founda tion
of plaintifff's claim, 1 D. 161; see 2 C. C. R. 459; 3 Id. 484. Where judgment
is rendered in the common pleas for money only and it is affirmed by the circuit
