when it has property within the State, or the cause of action arose therein, or
where such service shall be made in this State personally upon the President,
Cashier, Treasurer, attorney or Secretary, or any resident agent thereof.
Foreign corporation may appear solely to teat service upon a party "as resi

proper party to an action relating to real property in this State, such Court,
Judge, Clerk, Master, or Judge of Probate, may grant an order that the service
be made by publication of the summons in either of the follow ing cases : 1.
Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, has property within the State,
or the cause of action arose therein. 2. Where the defendant, being a resident
of this State, has departed therefrom with intent to defraud his creditors
or to avoid the service of a summons, or keeps himself concealed therein with
the like intent. 3. Where he is not resident of this State, but has property

the subject of the action is real or personal property in this State, and the
defend ant has or claims a lien or interest actual or contingent therein, or
the relief demanded consists wholly or partly in excluding the defendant from
any interest or lien therein. The order shall direct the publication to be made
in one newspaper, to be desig nated by the officer before whom the application
is made as most likely to give notice to the person to be served, and for
such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, not less than once a week for
six weeks. In case of publication the Court, Judge, Clerk, Master or Judge of
Probate shall also direct a copy of the summons to be forthwith deposited in
the postoffice, directed to the person to be served at his place of residence,
unless it appear that such residence is neither known to the party making the
application nor can with reasonable diligence be ascertained by him. Where
publication is ordered, personal service of the summons out of the State is
equivalent to publication and deposit in the postoffice. In case of minors in
like cases a similar order shall be made and like proceedings be had as in case
of adults. In case of persons imprisoned in the Penitentiary or in the jail of
any County in this State, and in case of lunatics confined in the Asylum, or in
any other place of confinement, personal service of the summons and complaint
or other process affecting the rights of such persons shall be made by the
Sheriff of the County in which such persons shall be imprisoned or confined,
with the like proof of service as required in case of minors ; and thereupon
the Judge of the Court of Trial Justice before whom the action is to be tried
shall appoint some attorney or other com- v—~v—-^ petent person to act as
guardian ad litem for any person so im prisoned or confined, who shall receive
out of the property of such persons a reasonable compensation for services
rendered in their behalf ; and the case shall proceed as in other cases of per
sons not under disabilities : Provided, That in cases of persons imprisoned or
confined as herein stated outside of this State, service by publication shall
be deemed sufficient. The defendant against whom publication is ordered, or his
representatives, on application and sufficient cause shown at any time before
judgment, must be allowed to defend the action ; and the defendant against whom
publication is ordered, or his representatives, may, in like manner, upon good
cause shown, be allowed to defend after judgment, or at any time within one
year after notice thereof, and within seven years after its rendi tion, on such
terms as may be just ; and if the defense be suc cessful, and the judgment, or
any part thereof, has been col lected or otherwise enforced, such restitution
may thereupon be compelled as the Court directs ; but the title to property sold
under such judgment to a purchaser in good faith shall not be thereby affected.
And in all cases where publication is made the complaint must be first filed,
and the summons, as published, must state the time and place of such filing.
In actions for the partition of real estate or for the foreclosure of mortgages
on real estate, if any party or parties having any interest in or lien upon
such mortgaged premises are unknown to the plaintifff, and the residence of
such party or parties cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained by him,
and such fact shall be made to appear by affidavit to the Court, a Judge, Clerk
of the Court, Master or Judge of Probate, where the trial is to be had, such
Court, Judge, Clerk, Master or Judge of Probate shall grant an order that the
summons be served on such unknown party or parties by publishing the same, for
six weeks, once a week, in a newspaper printed in the County where the premises
are situated, which publication shall be equivalent to a personal service on
such unknown party or parties. This Section relates only to Courts of record.
Trial Justice has no authority to grant order of publication.—Ferguson v.
Gilbert, 17 S. C, 96 ; Note, p. 29. In the absence of fraud or collusion, if
the affidavit satisfies the officer grant ing order of publication, his order
is final.— Yates v. Gridley, 16 S. C, 496; Bank v. Stelling, 31 S. C, 360. The
question of good faith cannot be made on mere motion to vacate judg ment ; can
only be made under formal proceeding.— Yatesv. Gridley, 16 3. C. A. D. 1804.
Where an agreement between member and foreign life insurance associa tion
provided that death claims should be made and paid at home office, the claims
of beneficiaries thereunder was not a cause of action that arose in this State,
and the foreign corporation having no property here it could not be made a party
to action here on such claim.—Rodgers v. Mutual Association, 17 S. C. , 406.
But when the subject matter was within the jurisdiction of the Court, and the
contract made as to it while the defendants were residents of this State, they
can be made parties, as non-residents, by publication.—Shu mate v. Harbin, 35
S. C. , 521. So, where all parties in interest are non-resi dents, they can be
so made parties in action to set aside assignment as to real property situate
here.— Dank v. Stelling, 31 S. C, 360. An order for service by publication is
absolutely required, even where there is personal service or its equivalent out
of the State. —Riker v. Vaughan, 23 S. C, 187. But when publication has been
ordered, personal service out of the State is equivalent to publication and
deposit in postoffice.—Darby v. Shan non, 19 S. C, 526. Only defendant can take
advantage of alleged insufficiency in service of summons.—lb. Proceedings
