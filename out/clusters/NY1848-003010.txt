persons be made parties.—Sullivan v. Latimer, 32 S. C, 281. This Section, as to
subdivision 1, must be construed to apply to such cases only as were not triable
by jury prior to 1868, and where an action on open ac count or account stated
presents no special feature of equitable cognizance the parties are entitled
to a jury trial, even though the examination of a long account may be involved.
— SmitK v. Bryce, 17 S. C, 538. Where a creditor, defendant, claims priority of
payment out of a fund in Court, through a lien on the property it represented,
the case was referable under this Section.—State v. R. R., 8 S. C, 129. So when
the defendant to an equitable action sets np a claim for damages, the Court may
still refer the case.—Lamar v. R. R., 10 S. C, 476 ; Bath Co. v. Langley, 23 S.
C, 145 ; Bouland v. Carpin, 27 S. C, 235. Mode of trial ;
