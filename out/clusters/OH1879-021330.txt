[75 v. 820 ; 57 v. 50, ยง 1 ; S. & C. 1272.] MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. When laws
take effect. Every law passed which con tains no provision as to the time when
it shall take effect, shall take effect on the first day of May next after its
passage. [77 R. S. 53 v. 153, \ 1.] An act may be shown by the journals of the
general assem bly to have been passed before the date it bears, and when so
shown it will speak from the day of its actual passage, 14 O. S. 472 ; and the
repealing clause takes effect ut the same time as the rest of the act, 16 O.
S. 193. Although an act may be expresslv repealed, yet if it appear that it was
intended that it should have temporary effect, the language of the repealing
clause will be retained accordingly, 1 O. S. 563. When a stat ute which repeals
a prior statute on the same subject is to take effect and be in force from
and after a day named, it does not take effect until the expiration of the day
named, 36 O. S. 584 ; but where a statute is to take effect ' ' from and after
its passage," and not from and after a day named in the act, the day it was to
be enacted is to be included ; but in the latter case it does not take effect
until the expiration of the day named, 39 O. S. 578 : 36 O. S. 584. A statute
declaratory of a former one has the same effect upon such former act in the
absence of intervening rights, as if the declaratory act had been embodied in
the original act at the time of its passage, 37 O. S. 275. Repeal of a repealing
act does not revive former act. Whenever a law is repealed which repealed a
former law, the -former law shall not thereby be revived. [ยง78 R.S.; 29 v.
513, ยง1.] Where a section of the Revised Statutes is repealed and reenacted
in a changed form, a subsequent statute, which in terms again repeals and re-
enacts the original section in still another form, is, as a general rule, to be
regarded as arepeal of the
