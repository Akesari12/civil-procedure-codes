—The words "in or out of the state " in line four from the end of this section
were added by ch. 140, acts 1891. Verification by an officer of a corporation.
—A verification to a complaint by an officer of a corporation need not set
forth " his knowledge or the grounds of his belief and the reason why it is
not made by the party." The verification by its officer is the verification
of the corporation itself. Bank v. Hutchinson, 87-22. When a pleading by a
corporation is required to be verified, the verifi cation must be made by an
officer thereof ; a verification by an agent merely will not suffice. Bank v.
Manufacturing Co., 108-282. Verification by an attorney or agent.—A verification
to a complaint by an attorney or agent of a non-resident to the effect that the
claim sued on is in writing and in his possession for collection, giving facts
in his per sonal knowledge and from other sources of information, is sufficient.
Johnson v. Maxwell, 87-18. A verification may be made by an agent or attorney
where the action or defense rests "upon a written instrument for the payment of
money only " and such instrument is in his hands, or the material allegations
lie within his personal knowledge, and in such case the affidavit itself must
show the knowledge or grounds of his belief and the reasons why it is not made
by the party himself. Cowles v. Hardin, 79-577. The statute in regard to the
verification of pleadings, contemplates only two cases in which the affidavit
may be made by the attorney : One, when the action is founded upon a written
instrument for the pay ment of money only, and such instrument is in the
possession of the attorney ; and the other, when the material allegations are
within the personal knowledge of the attorney. Hammerslaugh v. Farrior, 95-135.
Where a verification to a complaint stated that it was made by the attorney
because the plaintifffs were non-residents, and that his means of knowledge were
derived from an affidavit of the plaintifff, and from admissions made to him
by the defendant, but did not state that the material allegations were within
his persona1 knowledge : // was held, to be insufficient, and the defendant had
the right to file an unverified answer. Hammerslaugh v. Farrior, 95-135. When a
verification of a pleading is allowed to be made by an agent it should set forth
his knowledge, or grounds of belief, and why it is not made by the principal
party. Banks v. Manufacturing Co., 108-282. Verification need not be subscribed.
—An affiant is not required by the statute to subscribe the affidavit. It
is sufficient if the oath be admin istered by one authorized to administer
oaths. Alford v. McCormac, 90-151. Does not apply to auxiliary remedies. —The
requirements as to an "agent" under this section do not apply to affidavits
to procure ancillary reme dies. Bruff v. Stern, 81-183. Where verification is
required by statute. —Where a statute requires a complaint to be verified, a
failure to do so is a fatal defect, for which the judgment will be arrested.
Cowles v. Hardin, 79-577. Form of verification.—A verification that "the facts
set forth in the foregoing complaint are true," is sufficient. Alspaugh v.
Winstead, 79-526. A verification "to the best of the knowledge, information and
belief of the affiant," is insufficient. Benedict v. Hall, 76-113; Cowles v.
Hardin, 79-577. A verification discriminating between the facts averred upon
knowl edge and those resting upon information and belief is sufficient. Paige v.
Price, 78-10. Verification of amended or subsequent pleading by the same party.
—Where the same party files a properly verified pleading, either by reply or
amendment, it cures an insufficient verification of the first pleading. Benedict
v. Hall, 76-113. Before notary public.—A verification before a notary public out
of the state is insufficient. Benedict v. Hall, 76-113 ; Paige v. Price, 78-10.
Note. —This is now changed by the amendment since engrafted into above section.

can be used in a criminal prosecution against the party as a proof of a fact
admitted or alleged in such pleading : Pro vided, That the verification of any
pleading in any Court of record in this State may be omitted in all cases where
the party called upon to verify would be privileged from testifying as a witness
to the truth of any matter denied by such pleading. When matters are pleaded
upon knowledge, it is unnecessary to add the words "on information and belief."—
Smalls v. Wilder, 6 S. C, 402. So, where it is upon information and belief,
it is unnecessary to state that it is upon knowledge.—76. Where the answer is
negative merely of the complaint, the same form of verification is necessary.
—76. Where the complaint does not state which of its allegations are made on
knowledge and which on information and belief, the verification is insufficient
in form if it say that " the complaint is true of his own knowledge, except as
to matters therein stated on information and belief, and as to those matters
he believes it to be true."—Hecht v. Friesleben, 28 S. C, 181 ; Burnester v.
Mosely, 33 S. C, 251. Where the verification is made by another than the party,
it must set forth his knowledge or the grounds of his belief with sufficient
clearness.— 76. An attorney may verify a complaint only in two cases : 1.
Where the action is founded upon a written instrument and for payment of money
only, and that instrument is in his possession ; and, 2. Where all the material
allegations are within his personal knowledge.—Hecht v. Friesleben, 28 S. C,
181.
