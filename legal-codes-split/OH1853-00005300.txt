Before an action for the recovery of money is
brought against any person, he may go into the court of the
county of his residence, or of that in which the person having the cause of action re‘sides, which would have jurisdiction of the action, and offer to confess judgment in
favor of such person for a specified sum on such cause of
action. Whereupon, if such person, having had such notice that the offer would be made, of its amount, and of
the time and place of making it, as the court shall deem
reasonable, do not attend to accept the confession, or attending, refuse to accept it, and should afterwards commence an action upon such cause, and not recover more
than the amount so offered to be confessed, he shall pay
all the costs of the action; and on the trial thereof, the offer
shall not be deemed to be an admission of the cause of
action, or amount to which the plaintifff is entitled, nor be
‘ given in evidence.
