Upon the trial of an issue formed on an affidavit of il-1
legality, filed in the Superior or Inferior Courts, the jury tryingi
the case shall have power to assess such damages, not exceeding1
twenty-five per cent., as may seem reasonable and just, upon the
principal debt, provided it shall be made to appear that such
illegality was interposed for delay only.

“§ 3595. When an execution has been levied on property, and
an affidavit of illegality filed, to stay proceedings thereon, the
property so levied on, shall be subject to levy and sale under
other executions, and the officer making the first levy shall claim,
receive, hold and retain, such amount of the proceeds of the
sale, as the court shall deem suliicient to pay the execution first
levied, including interest up to the time of the court at which
said illegality shall be determined ; and any bond given by the
defendant, on iiling such affidavit, shall be released and discharged, so far as relates to the property sold. _
