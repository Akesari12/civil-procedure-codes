No judgment, heretofore rendered or which hereafter may be rendered, on which execution shall not have
been taken out and levied, before the expiration of one year
next after its rendition, shall operate as a lien on the estate

of any debtor, to the prejudice of any other bona fide judgment
creditor. But in all cases, where [judgment] has been or maybe
rendered in the district or supreme court, and a special mandate awarded to the court of common pleas, to carry the same
into execution, the lien of the judgment creditor shall continue
for one year after the first day of the term of the court of common pleas, to which such mandate may be directed. Nothing
in this subject contained, shall be construed to defeat the
lien of any judgment creditor, who shall fail to take out execution and cause a levy to be made as herein provided,
when such failure shall be occasioned by a peal, proceedings in error, injunction, or by a vacancy in t e office of sheriff and coroner, or the inability of such officer, until one
year after such disability shall be removed. In all cases,
where real estate has been or may hereafter be taken on execution and a praised, and twice advertised and offered for
sale, and shal remain unsold for want of bidders, it shall be
the duty of the court from which such execution issued, on
motion of the plaintifff, to set aside such appraisement, and
order a new one to be made, or to set aside such levy and
appraisement, and award a new execution to issue, as the
case may require.
