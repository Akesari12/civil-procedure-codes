mesne or final process, shall be surrendered by his bail or security,
and committed by the Sheriff to jail, it shall not be lawful for any
court to discharge such debtor from custody for the non-payment
or security of the jail fees, unless the Sheriff or jailor shall have
given at least ten daysâ€™ prior notice in Writing, to the plaintifff or
his attorney, who shall be allowed that time within which to pay
or give security for the jail fees, and thereby prevent such
discharge.
