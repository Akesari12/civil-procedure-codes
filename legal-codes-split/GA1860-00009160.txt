21. Communications to any attorney or his clerk to be
transmitted to the attorney pending his employment, or in anticipation thereof should never be heard by the court. So the
attorney cannot be compelled to disclose the advice or counsel
he may give to his client, nor to produce or deliver up title deeds,
or other papers, except evidences of debt, left in his possession by
his client. This rule does not exclude the attorney as a Witness to any facts which may transpire in connection with his

employment.
