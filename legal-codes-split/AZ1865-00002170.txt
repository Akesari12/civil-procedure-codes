After the iSSuing of an execution against property, and upon
proof by 'affidavit of a party, or otherwise to the satisfaction of the court
or a judge thereof, that any judgment debtor has property which he
unjustly refuses to apply towards the satiSfaction of the judgment, such .
court or judge may, .by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at
a specified time and place before such judge, or a referee appointed by
him, to answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon
be had for the application of the property of the judgment debtor towards
the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided upon the return of an
execution. '
