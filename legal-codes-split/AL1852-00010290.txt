If any witness duly summoned fails to attend, a
conditional line of ten dollars may be entered against him by
the justice; which must be made absolute if the witness,
upon notice issued by the justice, and served three days previous to the trial, fails to make a sufficient excuse, either in
person, by some one who knows the facts constituting the
excuse, or by affidavit before some justice of the peace, and
presented at the time designated for the trial thereof.
