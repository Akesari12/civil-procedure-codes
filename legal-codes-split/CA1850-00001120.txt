The defendant’s sureties upon a notice to the plaintifff of not less than two nor more than six
days, shall justify before a Judge or Justice of the Peace, in the same manner as upon bail on arrest;
upon such justification the Sheriff shall deliver the property to the defendant. The Sheriff shall be
responsible for the defendant’s sureties until they justify or until justification is completed or waived, and
may retain the property until that time; but if they, or others in their place, fail to justify at the time
and place appointed, he shall deliver the property to the plaintifff.
