From the time of the issuing of 'the order of
attachment, the court shall be deemed to have acquired
jurisdiction and to have control of all subsequent proceedings under this chapter; and if, after the issuing of the
order, the defendant being a person, should die, or a corporation, and its charter should expire by limitation, forfeiture,
or otherwise, the proceedings shall be carried on ; but in all
such cases other than where the defendant was a foreign corporation, his legal representatives shall be made parties to
the action.
