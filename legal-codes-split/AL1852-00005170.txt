If the ropert is not delivered accordin to the
condition of the bond, the sheriff must return it orfeited
within five days thereafter to the clerkâ€™s office out of which
the execution issued, indorsing thereon a forfeiture of the
bond; and it is then the duty of the clerk without delay to
issue execution on the forfeited bond, against all the obligors
therein, for the judgment and costs, upon which no security
of any kind can be taken, which he must indorse upon the
writ.
