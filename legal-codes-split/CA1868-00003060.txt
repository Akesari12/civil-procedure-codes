Issues how tried, and verdict what to be.

The issues formed may be tried as in other cases ; but when
the defendant denies, in his answer, any liability on the obligation upon which the judgment was rendered, if a verdict
be found against him, it shall be for the amount remaining

unsatisfied on such original judgment, with interest thereon.
Abb. Forms, 1833-1834.
