Amendments of pleadings.
The pleadings may be amended at any time before the

trial, to supply a deficiency or omission, when by such amendment substantial justice will be promoted. If the amendment be made after the issue, and it be made to appear to
the satisfaction of the Court, by oath, that an adjournment
is necessary to the adverse party in consequence of such
amendment, an adjournment shall be granted. The Court
may also, in its discretion, require as a condition of an amendment, the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed
by the Court, not exceeding twenty dollars; but such payment shall not be required unless an adjournment is made
necessary by the amendment; nor shall an amendment be
allowed after a witness is sworn on the trial, when an adjournment thereby will be made necessary.
