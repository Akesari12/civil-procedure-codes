Either party may challenge the jurors, but when there are several parties on either side, they must join in a challenge before it can be made. The challenges are to the panel and to individual jurors, as in criminal actions, except that there can be but two peremptory challenges on each side. And the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on the subject of challenges, and the disposition thereof, omitting section 415, are to apply, so far as in their nature applicable and consistent with the provisions of this code, to challenges in civil actions and the disposition thereof; substituting “plaintifff” for “people” and for “person alleged to be injured by the offense charged, or on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted.”
