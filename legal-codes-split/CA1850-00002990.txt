Parties to a question in difference which might be the subject of a civil action, may without
action agree upon a statement of the facts upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission
of the same to any Court which would have jurisdiction if the action had been brought. But it must
appear by affidavit that the controversy is real and the proceedings in good faith to determine the rights
of the parties. The Court shall thereupon hear and determine the same at a general term, and render
judgment thereon as if the action were depending.
