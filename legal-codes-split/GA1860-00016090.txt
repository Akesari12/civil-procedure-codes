The answer of defendant, (unless further time be
given,) shall be filed within thirty days after the first term of the
court. If the answer is not full, (where discovery is sought,) exceptions may be filed at once, and on ten daysâ€™ notice shall be argued and decided at chambers. If sustained, the Judge shall
require additional answer on such terms as he may direct. Exceptions must be filed before the hour for jury business, on the
second day of the second term.
