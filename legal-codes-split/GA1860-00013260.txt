If, upon a full examination into all the facts and circumstances of the case, it shall appear to the Justice that the comâ€”~
plaint is unfounded, the warrant shall be dismissed, and the party:

complained against shall be discharged, and permitted to retain
the custody and dominion of such person of color; but if, upon

such examination, said justice shall be satisfied that there is probable ground to believe that such person of color is improperly
and illegally held in such state of slavery, he shall give judgment
accordingly, and reduce the entire examination to writing.
