The illness or absence from Presidential cause of counsel, where there is but one, or of the leading counsel where there
are more than one, shall be a sufficient ground for a continuance,
provided the party making the application will swear, that he
cannot go safely to trial without the services of such absent counsel, that he expects his services at the next term, and that said
application is not made for delay only.
