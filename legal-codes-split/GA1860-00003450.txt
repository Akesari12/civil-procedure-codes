In all cases at law where the defendant has been servâ€˜ed with petition and process, as provided by this Code, he shall
appear at the court to which such process is made returnable, and
on or before the last day of said court, shall make his defense in
writing, which shall plainly, fully, and distinctly set forth his defense, and be signed by the defendant or his attorney, which said
answer shall contain as many several matters as such defendant
may think necessary for his defense.
