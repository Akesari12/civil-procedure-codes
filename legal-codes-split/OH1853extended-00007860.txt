If the place of the trial he changed, on account of
the justice being a material witness in the cause, such cause
shall be transferred for trial before some other justice of
the peace of the same township, if there be one there legally competent to try such cause; if there be no such
justice Within such township, or if such change be granted
on account of the bias or prejudice of the citizens of such
township against such party, or because the adverse party
has an undue advantage over him therein, the case shall
be taken! to some justice in an adjoining township of the
same county.
