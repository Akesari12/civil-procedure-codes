Whenever application is made for partition of lands
and tenements as hereinbefore provided for, and either of the
parties in interest shall make it satisfactorily appear to the court
that a fair and equitable division of the lands and tenements
cannot be made by means of .metes and bounds, by reason of improvements made thereon, or by reason of the premises being
valuable for mining purposes, or for the erection of mills or other
machinery, or that the value of the entire lands and tenements
will be depreciated by the partition applied for, then and in thatcase the court shall order a sale of such lands and tenements,
_and shall appoint three discreet persons to conduct such sale
runder such regulations, and upon such just and equitable terms
as said court may prescribe ; which sale shall take place on the
first Tuesday in the month, at the court-house of the county in
â€˜which the land is situated, after an advertisement of such sale in
'some public gazette of this State for at least thirty days.
