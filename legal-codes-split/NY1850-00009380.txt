No particular form of exception is required. The objection must be stated, with so much of the evidence as is necessary to explain it, but no more, and the whole as briefly as possible. If the decision excepted to be verbally made, it must, upon the exception being taken, be reduced to writing, and entered either in the judgeâ€™s minutes, or the minutes of the court, or in the statement.
