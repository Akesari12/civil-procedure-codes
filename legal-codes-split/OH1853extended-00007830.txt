The bill of particulars may be amended at any time
before the trial or during the trial, or upon appeal to supply any
deficiency, or omission in the items, when by such amendment, substantial justice will be promoted. If the amendment be made at the time of, or during the trial, and it be made
to appear to the satisfaction of the justice by oath, that an
adjournment is necessary to the adverse party in consequence of such amendment, an adjournment must be granted. The justice may also in his discretion, require as a
condition of an amendment, the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by the justice; but such payment
cannot be required, unless an adjournment is made necessary
by the amendment.
