A person for whose immediate benefit the action is prosecuted or defended, though not a
party to the action, may be examined as a witness in the same manner and subject to the same rules as
if he were named as a party.

 303. A party may be examined on behalf of his co-plaintifff or co-defendant; but the examination
thus taken shall not be used on behalf of the party examined; and whenever one of several plaintifffs or
defendants who are joint contractors, or who are united in interest, is examined by the adverse party,
the other of such plaintifffs or defendants may offer themselves as witnesses to the same cause of action
or defense, and shall be so received. ,
