—Period of Limitation—Objection must be taken by answer.

Civil actions can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title, after the cause of action shall have accrued,
except where, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute. But the objection that the action was not
commenced within the time limited, can only be taken by answer.
