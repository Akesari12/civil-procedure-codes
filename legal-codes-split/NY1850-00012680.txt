The verdict of the jury must be general, for the plaintifff, for a specified sum, or for the defendant; or when there is a counterclaim proved, exceeding the demand of the plaintifff as proved; for the defendant for a specified sum. But where there are several plaintifffs or defendants, the verdict may be for or against, one or more of them.
