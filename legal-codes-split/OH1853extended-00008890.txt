When any surety for the stay of execution shall
become apprehensive that by delaying the execution until

the expiration of the full time of such stay, he or she may
be compelled to pay the judgment, it shall be lawful for such
surety to make and file affidavit of that fact, before the justice on whose docket the judgment is entered; whereupon,
such justice shall issue execution against the judgment debtor, which shall be proceeded in as in other cases: Provided,
such bail shall not thereby be discharged from liability, but
may he proceeded against after the expiration of the term of
stay, in the same manner as if execution had not issued as
aforesaid.
