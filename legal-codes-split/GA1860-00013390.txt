If it shall appear at the final trial of such case that
the person of color is free, the court shall order him to be set at
liberty, and a guardian to be appointed for him according to
law, and the court shall also give judgment against the defendant for damages for the full value of the hire and services of such
person of color, during the time he was illegally held in slavery
by such defendant, unless the jury trying the case is satisfied
that the claim of the defendant was bond 354:3, under the belief
that the person of color was his slave.
