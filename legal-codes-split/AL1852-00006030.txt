Money or effects of the defendant in the hands of

Ba trustee, may be attached and held subject to the validity
of the instrument creating the trust; or the excess remaining
in the trusteeâ€™s hands, after the execution of the trust, if
valid; but if the deed be held void, the trustee, if not guilty
of actual fraud, may retain for a debt due himself, and must
be protected so far as he has acted in good faith under the
trust, before the levy of the attachment.
