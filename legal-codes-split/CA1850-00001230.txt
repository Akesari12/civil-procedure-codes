The Court or Judge shall require a written undertaking on the part of the plaintifff, with
sufficient surety, to the effect that the plaintifff will pay to the party enjoined such damages, not exceeding
an amount to be specified, as he may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the Court shall finally decide
that the plaintifff was not entitled thereto. The damages may be ascertained by a reference or otherwise,
as the Court shall direct.
