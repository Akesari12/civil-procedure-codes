shall justify on notice in like manner as upon bail or arrest; and the Sheriff shall be responsible for'the
sufiiciency of the sureties until the objection to them is either waived as above provided, or until they
shall justify, or new sureties shall be substituted and justify. If the defendant except to the sureties, he
