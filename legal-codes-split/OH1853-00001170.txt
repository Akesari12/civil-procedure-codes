Every pleading of fact must be verified by the
affidavit of the party, his agent or attorney. A pleading
verified as herein required, shall not be used against a party in
any criminal prosecution, or action, or proceeding for a penlaty or forfeiture, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in
such pleading; and such verification shall not make other
or greater proof necessary on the side of the adverse party.
