Where a judgment requires the payment of money, or the
delivery of real or personal pr0perty, the same shall be enforced in those
respects by execution. Where it requires the performance of any other
act, a certified copy of the judgment may be served upon the party
against whom it is given, or upon the person or oiiicer who is required
thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and his obedience thereto enforced.
