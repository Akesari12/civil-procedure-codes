A decree made against a defendant, without personal service, who does not appear, is not absolute for eighteen months from the rendition thereof; and in such case,
the court must direct a copy of the decree to be sent to such
defendant, or in case of infants, or lunatics, or married women,
(unless the suit or matter determined concerns their separate

estates,) to their guardians or husbands, if their residence can
be ascertained.
