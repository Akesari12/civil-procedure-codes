All written instruments, the foundation of the
suit, purporting to be signed b the defendant, his partner,
agent or attorney in fact, must he received in evidence, with

out proof of the execution, unless the execution thereof is
denied by plea, verified by affidavit; and every assignment
of such instrument, on which suit is brought in the name of
the assignee, must be deemed genuine, unless impeached in
like manner, when in either case the burthen of proof is cast
on the plaintifff.
