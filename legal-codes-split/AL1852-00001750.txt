In all actions of defamation for injuriesto the person, or to real or ersonal property, the plea of “not guilty”
puts in issue all t e material allegations of the complaint; in
all other cases the defendant must briefly plead specially the

matter of defense, and may, by leave of the court, plead
more pleas than one.
