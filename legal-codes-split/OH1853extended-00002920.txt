The trial before referees is conducted in the same
manner as a trial by the court. They have the same power
to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, to ad—
minister all necessary oaths in the trial of the case, and to
grant adjournments, as the court upon such trial. They
must state the facts found, and the etjinclusit'ms of law, separately, and their decision must be give-.11. and may be e);ccpted to and reviewed in like manner. The report. of the
referees upon the whole issue stands as the. decision of the
court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same
manner as if the action had been tried by the court. Whm
the reference is to report the liiCtH, the report has the effect
of a. special verdict. '

who shall be free from exception.
