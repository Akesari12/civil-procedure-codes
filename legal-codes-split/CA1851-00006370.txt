If the defendant, at any time before the trial, offer in writing
to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified-sum, the
plaintifff may immediately have judgment therefore, with the coats then'
accrued; but if he do not\aceept such offer before the trial, and fail to
recover in the action a sum equal to the offer, he shall not recover costs,
but costs shall be adjudged against him, and if he recover, deducted
from his recovery. But the offer and failure to accept it shall not be
given in evidence to affect the recovery otherwise than as to costs, as
above provided.
