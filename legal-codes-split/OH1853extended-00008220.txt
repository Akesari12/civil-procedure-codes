In all cases which shall be tried by a jury before a
justice of the peace, either party shall have the right to except to the opinion of the justice upon any question of law
arising during the trial of the cause; and when either party
shall allege such exception, it shall be the duty of the justice to sign and seal a bill, containing such exception, if truly
alleged, with the point decided, so that the same may be
made part of the record in the cause.
