If the return denies any of the material facts stated
in the petition, or alleges others upon which issue is taken, the
Judge or Justices hearing the return, may, in a summary manner, hear testimony as to such issue, and to that end may compel
the attendance of witnesses, the production of papers, or may adjourn the examination of the question, or exercise any other power of a court which the principles of justice may require.
