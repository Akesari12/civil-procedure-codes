Writs of error and certiorari to reverse, vacate, or
modify judgments, or final orders,in civil cases are abolished,
but courts shall have the same power to compel, complete, and
perfect transcripts of the proceedings containing the judgment
or final order sought to be reversed, to be furnished, as they
heretofore had under writs of error- and certiorari.
