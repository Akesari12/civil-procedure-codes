If the garnishee fail to appear and answer, or if
he appear and answer, and his disclosure is not satisfactory
to the plaintifff; or if he fail to comply with the order of the
court to deliver the property and pay the money owing, into
court, or give the undertaking l't‘qllil‘ml in the preceding section, the plaintifff may proceed against him in an action, by
filing a petition in his own name, as in other cases, and
causing a summons to be issued upon it ; and thereupon
such proceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment may be rendered in favor of the plaintifff, for the
amount of the property and credits of every kind of the defendant in the possession of the garnishee, and for what shall
appear to be owing by him to the defendant, and for the costs
of the proceedings against the garnishee. If the plaintifff
gamed against the garnishee by action, for the cause that

'sdisclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it appear in the action that such disclosure was incomplete, the plaintifff shall
pay the costs of such action. The judgment in this action
may be enforced as judgments in other cases. When the
claims of the plaintifffs in attachment are satisfied, the defendant in attachment may, on motion, be substituted as the
plaintifff in the judgment.
