After the judgment has been obtained in any case of
attachment, execution shall issue, as in cases at common law,
which execution shall be levied in the same manner as executions
issuing at common law, and the proceedings, in all respects, shall
be the same, except that when the judgment only binds the property levied on by the attachment, as aforesaid, the execution
shall be issued against such property only, and that property only
shall be levied on and sold.
