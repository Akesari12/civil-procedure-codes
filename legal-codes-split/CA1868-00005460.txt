1 . When the contract sued on is a joint contract of two defendants, and
judgment is entered up against one only, it is not such error as renders the
judgment void, so that it can be attacked in a collateral proceeding. Seaver
‘V. itzgerald, 32 Cal. 86.

2. A Justice's Court is not a Court of record; it is an inferior Court, and
its jurisdiction must be shown amrmatively b a party relying upon or claiming any right under its judgments; but paro evidence is admissible to show .
that the defendant was within its jurisdiction. Jolley v. Foltz, Oct. T. 1867.
