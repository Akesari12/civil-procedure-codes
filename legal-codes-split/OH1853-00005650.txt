If the judgment of a justice of the peace, taken on
error as herein provided to the court of common pleas, be
affirmed, it shall be the duty of such court to render judgment against the plaintifff in error, for the costs of suit, and
to award execution therefore; and the court shall thereupon
order its clerk to certify its decision in the premises, to the
justice, that the judgment affirmed may be enforced, as if
such proceedings in error had not been taken ; or such court
may award execution to carry into effect the judgment of
such justice, in the same manner as if such judgment had
been rendered in the court of common pleas.
