Upon the appearance of the witness, the commissioner, upon being satisfied that reasonable
notice has been given to the opposite party or his counsel to attend, shall proceed to take the deposition
of the witness, who, after being duly sworn, may be examined and cross-examined by the parties or their
counsel in the same manner as if examined on a trial in open court. The deposition when completed
shall be read over to the witness and signed by him. The commissioner shall then certify to the
deposition, and within five days shall file it in the court in which the action is pending. The Clerk
who receives it, shall endorse the time of its filing and the name of the commissioner by whom it was
delivered to him. A .
