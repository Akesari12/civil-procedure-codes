Any share or interest of a stockholder in any joint stock company may be levied upon or
attached by leaving an attested copy of the writ with the officer or person who has at the time the
custody of the books and papers of the company; and any share or interest so levied upon or attached,
with all the dividends that shall thereafter accrue, shall be held and sold to satisfy the judgment in like
manner as other property.
