The Justice shall, thereupon, within ten days after the
service of the notice of appeal on him, make a return to the
appellate court and file with the clerk thereof, the papers,
proceedings and judgment in the case, with the notice of
appeal served on him. He may be compelled to make such
return by attachment. But no Justice shall be bound to
make such return until the fees, prescribed by law for this \
service, be paid him. The fee, so paid, shall be included in
the costs, in case the judgment appealed from is reversed.
