Instead of the order requiring the attendance of
the judgment debtor, as provided in the last two sections, the
judge may, upon proof to his satisfaction, by affidavit of the
party, or otherwise, that there is danger of the debtor leaving
the state or concealing himself to avoid the examination
herein mentioned, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff to
arrest him and bring him before such judge within the county
in which the debtor may be arrested. Such warrant can be
issued only by a judge of probate or a judge of the court of
common pleas of the county in which such debtor resides or
may be arrested. Upon being brought before the judge, he
shall be examined on oath, and other witnesses may be examined on either side, and if on such examination it appear that there is danger of the: debtor leaving the state,
and that he has pro erty which herdnjustly refuses to apply
to such judgment, 'e may be ordered to enter into an undertalâ€™u'ng in such sum as the judge may prescribe, with one
or more sureties that he will from time to time attend for
examination before the judge or referee as shall be directed. In default of entering into such undertaking, he
may be committed to the jail of the county by warrant of
the judge, as for a contempt.
