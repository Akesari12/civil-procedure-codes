Every Chancery Court in this State may appoint a
Master, to whom it may refer such matters of account as are
complicated in their nature; or, by consent of parties, may appoint an Auditor to investigate and report upon similar matters
in dispute. Such Master or Auditor may subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths, and hear testimony on any disputed fact, always giving due notice of his sittings to the parties or their solicitors.
