Every application made to the Ordinary for the granting of any order, shall be by petition in writing, stating the
grounds of such application, and the order sought. If notice of
such application, other than by published citation, is necessary
under the law or in the judgment of the Ordinary, he shall cause
a copy of such application, together with a notice of the time of
hearing, to be served by the Sheriff, or some lawful officer, upon
the party or parties to be notified, at least ten days before the
hearing, and an entry of such service made on the original. In
extraordinary cases, where it is necessary to act before such notice
can be given, the Ordinary shall so direct the proceedings as to
make no final order until such notice has been given.
