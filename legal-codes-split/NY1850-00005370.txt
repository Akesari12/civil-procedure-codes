A sheriff, jailer or other officer, who demands or receives a reward or gratuity, to aid, assist or connive at the escape of a prisoner in his custody, is punishable for a misdemeanor; and if he be a sheriff, forfeits his office. If a sheriff be convicted, as provided in this section, the court must immediately report the fact of his conviction to the governor.
