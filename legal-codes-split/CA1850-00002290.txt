If it appear that a person, company, or corporation alleged to have property of the judgment
debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, such
interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an action against such person, company, or corporation, by
the receiver; but the Judge may by order forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or
interest, till a sufficient opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the action and prosecute the
same to judgment and execution; but such order may be modified or dissolved by the Judge granting
the same at any time on such security as he shall direct.
