When an appeal taken to the court of common
pleas shall there be quashed, by reason of irregularity in
taking or consummating the same, the cause for quashing
shall be stated in the order of the court, and a transcript
of such order shall be lodged with such justice, who shall
thereupon proceed to issue execution, in the same manner as
if no appeal had been taken.
