A levy may be made upon a growing crop when
there is no other property of the defendant known to the
sheriff, but no sale must be made thereof until the crop is
gathered. It is the duty of the sheriff at the request of the

laintiff, his agent or attorney, to employ hands if ractica1e and gather the crop, unless the defendant is wil ing and
offers to do so. When the crop is sold the proceeds must be
applied, first to repay the cost of gathering it, and afterward
to the satisfaction of the execution.
