If, at any time before or after judgment against the
bail, proceedings in error are commenced, on the judgment
against the principal in the suit, in which their undertaking
was taken, the court may on motion, stay proceedings
against such bail for a reasonable time, on their aying all
the costs that have accrued against them: and if), on such
proceedings, the judgment against the principal shall be reversed, and the principal discharged from said suit, the bail
shall be discharged from the undertaking.
