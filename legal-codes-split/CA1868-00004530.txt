Costs when a tender is made before suit brought.

When in an action for the recovery of money only, the defendant alleges in his answer that before the commencement
of the action he tendered to the plaintifff the full amount to

which he was entitled, and thereupon deposits in Court for
the plaintiliâ€˜ the amount so tendered, and the allegation be
found to be true, the plaintifff shall not recover costs, but
shall pay costs to the defendant.

In an action prosecuted or defended by an executor, administrator, trustee, of express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute, costs may be recovered as in action by
and against a person prosecuting or defending in his own
right; but such costs shall, by the judgment, be made chargeable only upon the estate, fund, or party represented, unless
the Court shall direct the same to be paid by the plaintifff or
defendant, personally, for mismanagement or bad faith in the

action or defense.

N. Y. Code, 6317.
