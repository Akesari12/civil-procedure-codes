The defendant may set off any claim or demand,
founded on a contract, express or implied, he held against
the plaintiff at the time the suit was instituted, whether the
same was liquidated or not; and if his claim is greater than
that of the plaintifff, may have judgment for the residue, if it
does not exceed fifty dollars.
