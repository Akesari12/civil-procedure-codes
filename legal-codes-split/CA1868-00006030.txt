‘Receivers in actitms respecting mining claims.

In actions respecting miners’ claims, in a J ustice’s Court,
the Justice shall have power upon application of the party
out of possession‘ of the claim or claims, after notice of one
day to the adverse party, to appoint a receiver of the proceeds of the claim, pending the action. If the parties agree
upon a person, he shall be appointed such receiver; if the
parties do not agree, the Justice shall appoint a receiver,
who shall take an oath, which shall be filed with ‘the J astice, that he is not interested in the action between the parties, and that he will honestly keep an account of all gold
dust or metals of any kind, the proceeds of the claim or
claims in dispute. After the appointment of such receiver,
the Justice shall have power to issue a written order to any
Sheriff or Constable, to put such receiver into possession of
such claim, which order said Sheriff or Constable shall execute, and the receiver shall remain in possession of the
claim or claims, so long as said action may remain undetermined in any Court. The Court in which the action may
be pending, shall have authority, upon the application of
either party, with two days’ notice to the other, from time
to time, to make such orders for the disposition of the proceeds of such claim or claims, for the safety of the same, as
may seem proper. The Court in which the action may be
pending, shall also have power, upon application of the receiver, based upon his affidavit, to punish as for contempt,
all persons who have been guilty of disturbing the receiver

in the possession of the claims.
