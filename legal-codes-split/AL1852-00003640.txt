If suit be brought on any moneyed demand, for a
less amount than that of which the court has jurisdiction, the
suit must be dismissed; or if suit be brought for such
amount, and a less sum be recovered, unless the amount is
reduced below that of which the court has jurisdiction, by a
set-off successfully made by the defendant. the judgment
must be set aside and the suit dismissed, unless he, or some
one for him, make affidavit, which must be filed in the cause,
that the amount sued for is actually due, and that a recovery
for the true amount was prevented by failure of proof, the
interposition of the statute of limitations, or some other sulficient cause, to be judged of by the court; and in that event,
he must have judgment for the reduced sum.
