. The court may, before, or after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper,
amend any pleading, process or proceeding, by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, [or] a mistake in any other
respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the
case, or, when the amendment does not change substantially the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading
or proceeding to the facts proved. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform, in any respect,
to the provisions of this code, the court may permit the
same to be made conformable thereto, by amendment.
