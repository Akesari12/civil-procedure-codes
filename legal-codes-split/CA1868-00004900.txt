Commencement of actions in Justices’ Courts.

Actions in Justices’ Courts shall be commenced by filing a
copy of the account, note, bill, bond, or instrument upon which
the action is brought, or a concise statement in writing of the
cause of action, and the issuance of a summons thereon, or

by the voluntary appearance and pleadings of the parties
without summons. In the latter case the action shall be
deemed commenced at the time of appearance.
