The court, at any time before the final submission
of the cause, on motion of the defendant, may allow a counterclaim or set-off, set up in the answer, to be withdrawn,
and the same may become the subject of another action.
On motion of either party, to be made at the time such
counterclaim or set-off is withdrawn, an action on the same
shall be'docketed and proceeded in as in like cases after
process served; and ,the court shall direct the time and manner of pleading therein. If an action be not so docketed, it
may afterwards be commenced in the ordinary way.
