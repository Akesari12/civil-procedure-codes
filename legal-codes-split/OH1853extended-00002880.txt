Upon the trial of questions of fact by the court,
it shall not be necessary for the court to state its finding,
except, generally, for the plaintifff or defendant, unless one
of the parties request it, with the view of excepting to the
decision of the court upon the questions of law involved in
the trial; in which case the court shall state in writing the
conclusions of fact found, separately from the conclusions
of law.
