No proceeding to reverse, vacate, or modify any
judgment rendered, or final order made by a justice of the
peace, shall operate as a stay of execution, unless the clerk
of the court of common pleas shall take a written undertaking to the defendant, executed on the part of the plaintifff in
error, by one or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that the
plaintifff will pay all the costs which have accrued, or may
accrue on such proceedings in error, together with the
amount of any judgment that may be rendered against
such plaintifff in error, either on the further trial of the case,
after the judgment of the court below shall have been set
aside, or reversed, or upon, and after the affirmance thereof
in the â€˜court of common pleas. The person entitled to such
proceeding, shall have the same time for rosecuting the
same, before he is barred, as is provided in e last section,
unless the said judgment has been paid off, or satisfied prior
to the commencement of such proceeding.
