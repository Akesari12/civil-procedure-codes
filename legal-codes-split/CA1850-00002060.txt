Any officer who shall sell any real estate without the previous notice herein required, or
otherwise than in the manner prescribed, shall forfeit one thousand dollars to the party injured, in
addition to any damages which such party may sustain ; but the omission of such officer to give notice
of the sale, or the taking down or the defacing the notice, shall not affect the validity of any sale made
to a purchaser in good faith, without notice of such omission or offense.
