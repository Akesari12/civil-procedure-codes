‘Money judgments and others, how enforced.

Where the judgment requires the payment of money or the
delivery of real or personal property, the same may be enforced by a writ of execution ; when it requires the performanoe of any other act, a certified copy of the judgment may
be served upon the party against whom the same is rendered,
or upon the person or oilicer required thereby or by law to
obey the same; obedience thereto may be enforced by the
Court; and after a final judgment of partition the Court

shall have power to enforce a severance of the possession.

‘ ‘Amended 1866, 703. Applicable to Justices’ Courts.

1. A levy under an execution, upon sufficient personal property to satisfy
the same, is a satisfaction of the judgment, sumcient at least to discharge
third persons who are liable collaterally or as sureties therefore; and a
release of the property from levy thus made, without consent of the parties
thus liable, cannot revive their liability. Mulford v. Estudillo, 23 Cal.

2. The law does not deem such 8 payment, but-it is a satisfaction or dis?

charge. Id. See also 8 Cal. 80.
3. Where process of a Court, as an execution, commanding the sherin‘ to deliver possession of a chattel, has been finally and completely executed, the
power of the sheriff under it, and the authority of the Court to enforce it,
cease; and a wrong doer, afterwards trespassing upon the person thus put in
possession. cannot be deemed guilty of contem t for disobedience to the proease of the Court. Per Bennett, J. Loring v. llsley, 1 Cal. 24.
