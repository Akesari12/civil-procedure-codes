In case the party applying for leave to amend the
Ipleadings or other proceedings shall have been guilty of negligence in respect to the matter of amendment, the court may
compel him to pay his adversary the cost of the proceedings for
which he moves, and may force reasonable and equitable terms
upon him at discretion, not touching the real merits of the cause
in controversy.
