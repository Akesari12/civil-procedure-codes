The punishment for the contempt mentioned in
section three hundred and twenty-two shall be as follows:
When the witness fails to attend in obedience to the subpoena (except in case of a demand and failure to pay his
fees) the court or officer may fine the witness in a sum not
exceeding fifty dollars. In other cases, the court or officer
may fine the witness in a sum not exceeding fifty nor less
than five dollars, or may imprison him in the county jail,
there to remain until he shall submit to be sworn, testify, or
give his deposition. The fine imposed by the court shall be
paid into the county treasury, and that imposed by the
officer, shall be for the use of the party for whom the witness was subpoenaed. The witness shall, also, be liable to
the party injured, for any damages occasioned by his failure
to attend, or his refusal tobe sworn, testify, or give his deposition.
