The presiding Judge before whom any writ of certioâ€”
raw? may be heard, on motion of the opposite party, may order
that damages, not more than twenty per cent., be recovered by
the defendant against the plaintifff in certiorari and his security,
in case it shall be made to appear that the said certiorari was
frivolous, and applied for without good cause, or for the purpose
of delay only, and judgment may be entered up and execution
issued accordingly.
