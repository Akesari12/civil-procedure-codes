Penalty for disobedience to the writ of mandate.

When a peremptory mandate has been issued and directed
to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, if it appear to the Court that any member of such tribunal, corporation, or board, or such person upon whom the writ has been
personally served, has, without j ust excuse, refused or neglected
to obey the same, the Court may, upon motion, impose a line
not exceeding one thousand dollars. In case of persistence in
a refusal of obedience, the Court may order the party to be
imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months, and may
make any orders necessary and proper for the complete enforcement of the writ. If a fine be imposed upon a Judge or oiiieer
who draws a salary from the State or county, a certified copy
of the order shall be forwarded to the Comptroller, or County
Treasurer, as the case may be, and the amount thereof may
be retained from the salary of such Judge or oiiicer. Such
Judge or officer for his willful disobedience shall also be

deemed guilty of a misdemeanor in office.
