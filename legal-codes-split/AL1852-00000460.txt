Real actions to try the title, or for the recovery of
the possession of lands, and actions for injuries to lands, survive in favor of heirs, devisees, or personal representatives,
and against heirs, devisees, tenants, or personal representatives, according to their respective rights, and the court must
direct the record and judgment to be so framed as to secure
their rights and declare their respective interests.
