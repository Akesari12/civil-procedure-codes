The justice before whom the complaint is exhibited must issue subpoenas for witnesses, at the request of
either party, which may be served either by the sheriff or by
a constable. Either party may also take the testimony of
any witness living out of the county of the trial, by deposition, as in other cases before justices of the peace.
