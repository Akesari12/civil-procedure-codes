The several courts shall have power, on the trial of any
cause cognizable before them respectively, on notice and proof
thereof being previously given by the opposite party or his attorney, to require either party to produce books, writings and other
documents in his possession, power, custody or control, which
shall contain evidence pertinent to the cause in question, under
circumstances where such party might be compelled to produce
the same by the ordinary rules of proceeding in equity.
