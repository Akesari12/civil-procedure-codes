and no specific sum agreed on as rent.

2. Where, after a demise, the tenant holds over without
any further agreement for rent.

3. â€œThen the tenant has been let into possession upon a
supposed sale of the lands, which from the act of the tenant
has not been consummated.

4. When the tenant remains on the land by the sufferance
of the owner. .
