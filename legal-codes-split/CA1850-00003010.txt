Either party may exhibit to the other or to his attorney at any time before the trial,
any paper material to the action, and request an admission in writing of its genuinenese. If the
adverse party or his attorney fail to give the admission within four days after the request, and if the
party exhibiting the paper he afterwards put to expense in order to prove the same, and it be finally
proved or admitted on the trial, such expense, to be ascertained at the trial, shall be paid by the party

refusing the admission, unless it appear to the Court that there were good reason for the refusal. The
Court before which an action is pending, or a Judge thereof, may/in their discretion and upon due notice,
order either party to give to the other within a specilied time, an inspection and copy, or permission
to take a copy, of any books, papers, and documents, in his possession or under his control, containing
evidence relating to the merits of the action or the defense therein. If compliance with the order be
refused, the Court on motion may exclude the paper from being given in evidence, or punish the party
refusing, or both. .
