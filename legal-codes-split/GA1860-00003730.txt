may plead and give in evidence to the ury, upon the trial thereof, that the consideration upon which said contract was founded
has totally or partially failed; such plea shall only be pleaded
in cases between the original parties to the contract, or their
privies or assignees, whose title has been acquired with notice,
actual or constructive, or by operation of law.
