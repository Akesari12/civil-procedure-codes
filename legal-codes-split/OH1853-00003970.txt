Every attorney, who shall confess judgment in any
case, shall, at the time of making such confession, produce
the warrant of attorney for making the same, to the court
before which he makes the confession, and the original, or a
copy of the warrant shall be filed with the clerk of the court
in which the judgment shall be entered.
