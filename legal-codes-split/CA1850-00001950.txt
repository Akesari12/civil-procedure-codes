If the officer having an execution or attachment against any such stockholder shall exhibit
the writ to the officer of the company appointed to keep a record or account of the shares or interest of
the stockholders therein, and shall request a certificate of the number of shares, or amount of interest
held by the defendant, such officer of the company shall give such certificate to the person holding the
writ; and if he shall refuse to do so, or if he give a false certificate, he shall be liable for double the
amount of all damages sustained by reason of such refusal or false certificate, unless the judgment is
satisfied by the original defendant.
