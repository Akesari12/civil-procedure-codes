â€”Costs In action by or against an executor or administrator, trustees of
an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute to sue.

(1.) In an action prosecuted or defended by an executor,
administrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person
expressly authorized by statute, costs shall be recovered, as
in an action by and against a person prosecuting or defending in his own right; but such costs shall be chargeable only

upon or collected of the estate, fund, or party represented,
unless the cOurt shall direct the same to be paid by the
plaintifff or defendant personally, for mismanagement or bad
faith in such action or defense. But this section shall not be
construed to allow costs against executors or administrators where they are now exempted therefrom by law. (2.)
And whenever any claim against a deceased person shall be referred, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the
fees of referees and witnesses, and other necessary disbursements, to be taxed according to law.
