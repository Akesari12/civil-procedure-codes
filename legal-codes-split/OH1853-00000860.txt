When any part of real property, the subject matter
of an action, is situated in any other county or counties than
the one in which the action is brought, a certified copy of the
judgment in such action must be recorded in the recorderâ€™s
office of such other county or counties, before it shall operate
therein as notice, so as to charge third persons, as provided in the preceding section. It shall operate as such notice, without record, in the county where it is rendered; but
this section shall not apply to actions or proceedings under
any statute now in force, which does not require such record.
