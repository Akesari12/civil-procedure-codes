Rights of civil action given, or secured by existing
laws, shall be prosecuted in the manner provided by this
code, except as provided in section six hundred and four. If
a case ever arise, in which an action for the enforcement or
protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong,
cannot be had under this code, the practice heretofore in
use, may be adopted, so far as may be necessary to prevent
a failure of justice.
