or otherwise, as to all knowledge acquired by either party by reason of the marriage relation. An exception to this general rule

exists in all cases where, from necessity or convenience, the oath
of the party is received by the court in proof of facts preliminary to other evidence, or in the conduct of a cause. The evidence
of the party is also received in od'ium apolitatoris when after
proof of the tort, the extent of the injury may be proved by him,
and against a bailor guilty of negligence, to show the extent of
the loss, there being no other evidence within the partyâ€™s power;
and in certain Inferior Courts where by law this evidence is
admitted.
