In all cases where any defendant of whom bail shall
be required shall fail to give good and suthcient bail, it shall be
the duty of the Sheriff or other officer making the arrest, to commit such defendant to the common jail of the county, or if there
shall be no jail in the county, or the same shall be insufficient, the
said Sheriff, or other arresting officer, shall convey such defendant to the jail of any adjoining county, and deliver such defendant to the keeper of said jail, but such person so arrested and
committed to jail shall be allowed all the benefits of appearance
and defense, as if he were personally present; and shall not be
discharged out of custody but by putting in bail, or by order of
court.
