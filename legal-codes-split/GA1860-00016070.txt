A demurrer denies the right to the discovery or relief,
in whole or in part, admitting the allegations of the bill to be
true, and is founded either upon a want of jurisdiction in the
court, or of equitable right in the complainant, or upon a non:
joinder or misâ€”joinder of parties, or causes of action, or the absence of liability by the defendant to the complainant.
