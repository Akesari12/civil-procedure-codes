It is the duty of the several clerks of the circuit
courts, and judges of the probate courts, to have and keep
posted up in a conspicuous place in their respective offices, a
complete list of all the fees allowed by law to them, and to
the sheriff's; and must also keep a copy ready to be produced, on the application of any person wishing to see the same.
