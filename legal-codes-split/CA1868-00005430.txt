1. Suit brought in Justice’s Court for township No. 5. service on defendant
in township No. 3, by Constable of township No. 3. Defendant appears, and
before filing answer, moves to dismiss the action on the grounds: lst. That
the Court has no jurisdiction of the person of defendant. 2d. That the return
of the officer is insumcient to give jurisdiction. Held, that the motion was
properly denied; that defendant could not thus defeat the whole case in limine
upon the insudlciencies of the record, though the action might be thus dismissed if the facts were shown to be such that the record could not be amended.
