After hearing the charge, the jury may either decide in court
or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they shall be kept together in a
room provided for them, or some other convenient place, under the charge
of one or more officers, until they agree upon their verdict or are discharged by the court. The officer shall, to the utmost of his ability, keep
the jury together, separate from other persons; he shall not suffer any
communication to be made to them, or make any himself, unless by order
of the court, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict ;
and he shall not, before the verdict is rendered, communicate to any person A
the state of their deliberations or the verdict agreed upon.
