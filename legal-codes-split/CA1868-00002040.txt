‘Partial partition.

Whenever from any cause it shall have become, in the
opinion of the Court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to
make a complete partition, in the first instance among all the
parties in interest, it shall be lawful for the Court to first
ascertain and determine the shares or interest respectively
held by the original co-tenants, and thereupon to adjudge
and cause a partition to be made, as if such original co-tenants
were the parties and sole parties in interest and the only
parties to the action, and thereafter to proceed in like manner to adjudge and make partition separately of each share
or portion so ascertained and allotted, as between those
claiming under the original tenant to whom the same shall
have been so set apart, or allow them to remain tenants in

common thereof, as they may desire.
‘Amended 1866, 705.
