Upon the rendition of a judgment in favor of a party
against an executor or administrator upon any liability of the deceased, and a return of nulla bona by the Sheriff or other officer
authorized to make the same, the said party may at once proceed
to sue upon the bond of the executor or administrator, and may
recover judgment against the principal and his sureties in the
same action, and if the principal has removed beyond the limits

of this State, or has departed this life, or has no legal representative, then he may sue the sureties on his bond.
