The officer who levies u on goods and chattels,
or lands and tenements, or who is charged with the duty of
selling the same by virtue of any writ of execution, may
refuse to publish a notice of the sale thereof by advertisement in a newspaper, until the party for whose benefit such
execution issued, his agent, or attorney, shall advance to
such officer, so much money as will be sufficient to discharge
the fees of the printer, for publishing such notice.
