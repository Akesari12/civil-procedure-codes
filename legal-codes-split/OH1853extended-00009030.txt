Where a constable shall have levied on any goods
and chattels which remain unsold for want of bidders, or
other just cause, it shall be his duty to return with the execution a schedule of all such goods and chattels. And the
justice shall, unless otherwise directed by the party for
whom such execution issued, or his agent, immediately thereafter, issue an order, thereby commanding any constable to
whom the same may be directed or delivered, to expose such
property to sale; which sale, and the proceedings thereon,
shall â€˜be the same as if such property had been sold on the
original execution.
