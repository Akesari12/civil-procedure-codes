â€˜Nor a physician as to any information necessarily acquired in that capacity.

A licensed physician, or surgeon, shall not, without the consent of his patient, be examined as a witness, as to any information acquired in attending the patient, which was necessary to enable him to prescribe, or act for, the patient ; provided, however, in any suit, or prosecution, against a physician,
or surgeon, for malpractice, if the patient, or party, suing, or
prosecuting, shall give such consent, and any such witness
shall give testimony, then such physician, or surgeon, defendant, may call any other physicians, or surgeons, as witnesses
on behalf of defendant, without the consent of such patient,

or party suing, or prosecuting.
