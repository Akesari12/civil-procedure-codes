-From the time of the service of the summons in a civil
action, or the allowance of a provisional remedy, the court
is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have cOntrol
of all the subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance
of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon him.

In an action affecting the title to real property, the plaintifff, at the time of filing the complaint, or at any time afterwards, or whenever a warrant of attachment, under chapter
tour, of title ten, of this Code, shall be issued, or at any
time afterwards, the plaintifff, or a defendant when he sets
'up an affirmative cause of action in his answer and demands
substantive relief, at the time of filing his answer, or at any.
time afterwards, if the same be intended to affect real estate,
may file with the clerk of each county in which the property
is situated, a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties, the object of the action, and
the description of the property in that county affected thereby; and if the action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage,
such notice must be filed twenty days before judgment, and
must contain the date of the mortgage, the parties thereto,
and the time and place of recording the same. From the
time of filing only shall the pendency of the action be conStructive notice to a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby; and every person whose conveyance
or encumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently
recorded, shall be deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, and shall be bound by all proceedings taken after

the filing of such notice, to the same extent as if he were
made a party to the action. For the purposes of this section, "
an action shall be deemed to be pending from the time of
filing such notice; provided, however, that such notice shall
be of no avail unless it shall be followed by the first publication of the summons on an order therefore, or by the personal
service thereof on a‘ defendant within sixty days after such
filing. And the court in which_ the said action was commenced may, in its discreticm, at any time after the action °
shall besettled, discontinued, or abated, as is provided in '
section number sixty-four, on application of any person
aggrieved, and on good cause shown, and on such notice as
shall be directed or approved by the court, order the notice
authorized by this section to be canceled of record by the
clerk ofany county in whose office the same may have been
filed or recorded; and such cancellation shall be made by an
indorsement to that effect on the margin of the record, which
shall refer to the order, and for which the clerk shall be
entitled to a fee of twenty-five cents.
