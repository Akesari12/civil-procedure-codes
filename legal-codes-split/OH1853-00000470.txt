Upon affidavit of a defendant before answer, in any
action upon contract, or for therrecovery of personal prOperty, that some third party, without collusion with him, has or
makes a claim to the subject of the action, and that he is
ready to pay or dispose of the same, as the court may direct, the court may make an order for the safe-keeping, or
for the payment, or deposit in court, or delivery of the subject
of the action, to such person as it may direct, and an order
requiring such third party to appear in a reasonable time
and maintain or relinquish his claim against the defendant.
If such third party being served with a copy of the order, by
the sheriff, or such other person as the court may direct, fail
to appear, the court may declare him barred of all claim in
respect to the subject of the action, against the defendant
therein. If such third party appear, he shall be allowed to
make himself defendant in the action, in lieu of the original
defendant, who shall be discharged from all liability to either
of the other parties in respect to the subject of the action,
upon his compliance with the order of the court for the payment, deposit, or delivery thereof.
