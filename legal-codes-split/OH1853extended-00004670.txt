In all cases, where two or more executions shall
be put into the hands of any sheriff, or other officer, and it
shall be necessary to levy on real estate to satisfy the same,
and either of the judgment creditors in whose favor one or
more of said executions is issued, shall require the sheriff, or
other officer, to make a separate levy to satisfy his execution, or executions, it shall be the duty of the sheriff, or other
officer, to levy said executions, or so many thereof as may
be required, on separate parcels of the real property of the
judgment debtor, or debtors ; giving to the officer making the
levy on behalf of the creditor, whose execution may, by the
provisions of this chapter, be entitled to a reference, the
choice of such part offthe. real. property of? the judgment

debtor, or debtors, as will be sufficient, at two-thirds of the
appraised value, to satisfy the same. And in all cases where
two or more executions, which are entitled to no preference
over each other, are put into the hands of the same officer, it
shall be the duty of the officer, when required, to levy the
same on separate parcels of the real property of the judgment debtor, or debtors, when, in the opinion of the appraisers, the same may be divided without material injury : and
if the real property of said debtors will not be sufficient, at
two-thirds of its appraised value, to satisfy all the executions
chargeable thereon, such part of the same shall be levied on
to satisfy each execution, as will bear the same proportion in
value to the whole, as the amount due on the execution,
bears to the amount of all the executions chargeable thereon, as near as may be, according to the appraised value of
each separate parcel of said real property.
