The adverse party may answer under oath.

On the return of the alternative, or the day on which the
application of the writ is noticed, or such further day as the
Court may allow, the party on whom the writ or notice shall
have been served may show cause by answer under oath,
made in the same manner as an answer to a complaint in a
civil action. â€˜
