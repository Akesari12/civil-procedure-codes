Any witness whose testimon is thus required,
and who fails on due notice to appear before the commissioner and give evidence, forfeits to the party aggrieved the
sum of one hundred dollars, for which judgment may be
rendered by the court where the cause is pending, five daysâ€™
notice in writing having been given him, that such motion
will be made; and is also liable at the suit of the party aggrieved, to an action for damages; but such witness may
make his excuse as in other cases.
