—Entry of the verdict. Motion for new trial on Judge’s minutes(1.) Upon receiving a verdict, the clerk shall make anentry in his minutes, specifying the time and place of the
trial, the names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict, and
either the judgment rendered thereon, or‘ an order that the
cause be reserved for argument or further consideration. If
a different direction be not given by the court, the clerk
must enter judgment in conformity with the verdict. 

If an exception be taken, it may be reduced to writing at
the time, or entered in the Judge’s minutes, and afterwards
settled as provided by the rules of the court, and then stated
in writing in a case, or separately, with so much of the evidence as may be material to the questions to be raised, but
a bill of exceptions need not be made. (3.) If the exceptions be in the first instance stated in a case, and it be
necessary to separate them, the separation may be made
under the direction of the Judge. (4.) The Judge who
tries the cause may, in his discretion, entertain a motion, to
be made on his minutes, to set aside a verdict and grant a
new trial upon exceptions, or for insquicient evidence, or for
. excessive damages; but such motion can only be heard at
the same term at which the trial is had. When such motion
' is heard and decided upon the minutes of the Judge, and an
appeal is taken from the decision, a case or exceptions must
be settled in the usual form, upon which the argument of
the appeal must be had.
