The writ of injunction as a provisional remedy is abolished, and an injunction by order is
substituted therefore. The order may be made by the Court in which the action is brought or by a
Judge thereof, or by a County Judge, in the cases provided in the next section, and when made by a
Judge may be enforced as the order of the Court.
