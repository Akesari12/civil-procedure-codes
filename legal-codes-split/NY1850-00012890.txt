Upon a justice’s judgment docketed in a county clerk’s office, execution can only be issued by the clerk with whom the transcript is filed, or by the plaintifff in person: and it may be sent to one or more counties where the judgment is docketed. It must conform substantially to the execution issued by a justice, except that it must state the time when the judgment was docketed in the county from which it is issued, and must be directed to the sheriff; and may direct, that for want of sufficient personal property, the debt be made out of the real property of the debtor.
