Parties to a question which might be the subject
of a civil action, may, without action, agree upon a case
containing the facts upon which the controversy depends,
and present a submission of the same to an court which
would have jurisdiction, if an action had een brought.
But it must appear by affidavit that the controversy is real,
and the proceedings in good faith, to determine the rights
of the parties. The court shall, thereupon, hear and determine the case, and render judgment, as if an action were
pending. - '
