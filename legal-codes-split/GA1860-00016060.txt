Verification—when necessary.

 

 

‘ §4101. A defendant may either demur, plead or answer to a
cause in equity, or may file two or all of these defenses at once,
without waiving the benefit of either, or may file two or more
pleas to the same action in like manner as at law. In all cases,
demurrer, pleas and answer shall be disposed of in the order
named; and all demurrers and pleas shall be filed and determined at the first term, unless continued by the court or by consent of parties.
