Several actions brought on a single cause of action shall
carry costs in but one.

When several actions are brought on one bond, undertaking, promissory note, bill of exchange, or other instrument
in writing, or in any other case for the same cause of action,
against several parties who might have been joined as defendants in the same action, no costs shall be allowed to the
plaintifff in more than one of such actions, which may be at
his election, if the party proceeded against in the other actions were, at the commencement of the previous action
openly within this State ; but the disbursements of the plaintill‘ shall be allowed to him in each section [action].

N. Y. Code, § 304.

1. Where an action has been commenced against several defendants, and
there has been a judgment in their favor, they are not all entitled to recover
separate costs to the amount allowed by the act, but can only recover jointly,
as though there had been but one defendant. Rice v. Leonard etal.. 5 Cal. 61.

2. Possibly as the entry of such several judgments in ejectment increases
the costs, it would be ground for retaxing or apportioning them. Lick v.
Stoclodale, 18 Cal. 219.

See post, § 495.
