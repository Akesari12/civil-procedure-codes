The judgment of the circuit court, condemning the
debt or pro erty in the hands of the garnishee, to the satis[faction of t e plaintifff ’s demand, is conclusive as between
the garnishee and the defendant, to the extent of such ju
ment, unless the defendant prosecute an appeal from su
judgment, which he may do in his own name; and if such
jud ent is superseded by bond, and the‘ garnishee notified
of t e fact, he is not permitted to discharge such judgment
pending the appeal.
