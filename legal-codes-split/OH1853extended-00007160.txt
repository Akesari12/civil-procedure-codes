The jury shall not be discharged after the cause is
submitted to them, until they have agreed upon and rendered
their verdict, unless the probate judge, upon their disagreement, shall sooner discharge them; and when they shall have
so agreed upon their verdict, they shall deliver it publicly to
the probate judge, who shall enter it in his minutes.
