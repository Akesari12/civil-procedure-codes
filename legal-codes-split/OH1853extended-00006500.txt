Where, by statute, a civil action, legal or equitable,
is given, and the mode of proceeding therein is prescribed,
this code shall not affect the proceedings under such statute,
until the legislature shall otherwise provide; but the parties
may, if they see fit, proceed under this act: and in all such
cases, as far as it may be consistent with the statute giving
such action and practicable under this code, the proceedings

shall be conducted in conformity thereto. Where the statute
designates by name or otherwise, theâ€˜kind of action, but does
not prescribe the mode of proceeding therein, such action
shall be commenced and prosecuted in conformity to this
code ; where the statute gives an action, but does not designate the kind of action, or prescribe the mode of proceeding
therein, such action shall be held to be the civil action of this
code, and proceeded in accordingly.
