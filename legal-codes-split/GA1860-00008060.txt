In all cases where a levy is made upon property that
is claimed by a third person, and such person shall desire the possession thereof, it shall be the duty of the Sheriff or other levying

officer to take bond with good security, for a sum equal to double
the value of the property levied on, to be estimated by the levying officer for the delivery of such property at the time and place
of sale, provided the property so levied upon shall be found subject to such execution.
