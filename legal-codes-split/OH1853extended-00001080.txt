When it appears that a new party is necessary to
a final decision upon the set-off, the court shall permit the
new party to be made, if it also appear, that owing to the
insolvency or non-residence of the plaintifff, or other cause,
the defendant will be in danger of losing his claim, unless
permitted to use it as a set-off.
