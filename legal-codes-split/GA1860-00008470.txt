Presumptions of law are sometimes conclusive, and an
averment to the contrary will not be allowed. These are termed
estoppels, and are not generally favored. Among these are the
presumptions in favor of a record or judgment unreversed, of the
proper conduct of courts and judicial oiiicers acting within their
legitimate sphere. Of other ochers of the law after lapse of
time has rendered it dangerous to open the investigation of their
acts in regard to mere formalities of the law. Of ancient deeds,
and other instruments more than thirty years old, when they
come from the proper custody, and possession has been held in
accordance with them. Recitals in deeds, except payment of
purchase money as against the grantor acting in his own right,
and sui jure's and his privies in estate, blood and in law. The
landlordâ€™s title, as against his tenant, while tenant in possession.
Solemn admissions made in judicio, and other admissions, upon
which other parties have acted, either to their own injury or the
benefit of the persons making the admissions, and similar cases
where it would be more unjust and productive of more evil to
hear the truth than to bear the investigation.
