money only, may, at any time before the trial, serve upon
the plaintifff, or his attorney, an offer in writing, to allow
judgment to be taken against him for the sum specified
therein. If the plaintifff accept the offer, and give notice
thereof to the defendant, or his attorney, within five days
after the offer was served, the offer and an affidavit that the
notice of acceptance was delivered in the time limited, may
be filed by the plaintifff, or the defendant may file the acceptance, with a copy of the offer verified by affidavit : and, in
either case, the offer and acceptance shall be noted in the
journal, and judgment shall be rendered accordingly. If the
notice of acceptance be not given in the period limited, the
offer shall be deemed Withdrawn, and shall not be given in
evidence, or mentioned on the trial. If the plaintifff fails to
obtain judgment for more than was offered by the defendant,
he shall pay the defendantâ€™s costs from the time of the offer.
