Pleadings, manner of presenting, and form of.

When the pleadings are oral, the substance of them shall
be entered by the Justice in his docket; when in writing
they shall be filed in his office, and a reference to them made
in the docket. Pleadings shall not be required to be in any
particular form, but shall be such as to enable a person of '

common understanding to know what is intended.

I. It is not the policy of the law to condne parties to any nice strictness in
pleading, particularly before Justices of the Peace; accordingly, when a party,
instead of demurring for informality,’ oes to trial, it must be considered as
cured by the verdict. Cronise v. Carg ' , 4 Cal. 120.

2. Pleading in Justices’ Courts construed with great liberality; and if the
facts stated be snmcient to show the nature of the claim or defense, nothing

further is required. To reverse a judgment had in such Courts for defects in
the complaint, the defects should be such as were calculated to mislead the
adverse party. Stuart v. Lander, 16 Cal. 372.
