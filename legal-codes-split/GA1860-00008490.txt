The testimony of a single witness is generally sufficient
to establish a fact. Exceptions to this rule are made in specified

cases: such as to convict of treason of perjury; in any case of}
felony, where the only witness is an accomplice; and to rebut a1
responsive statement in an answer in equityâ€”in these cases (except in treason) corroborating circumstances may dispense with

another witness.
