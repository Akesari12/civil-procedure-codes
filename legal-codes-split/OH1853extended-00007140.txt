Each party shall be entitled to two peremptory
challenges, and such other challenges for cause, as the probate judge may allow; and if six jurors do not attend or be
not obtained, the judge may direct the sheriff or other officer in attendance to summon any of the bystanders or others,
who may be competent, against whom no sufficient cause of
challenge shall appear,to act as jurors. \Vhen six jurors appear, and are accepted, they shall constitute the jury. The
failure to attend by any person when duly summoned, shall
be punished as in like cases in the court of common pleas.
And the jury, when so sworn or affirmed, shall hear the
proofs of the parties, which must be delivered in public and
in the presence of the defendant.
