No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof shall be deemed material,
unless it have actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense
upon the merits. \Vhenever it shall be alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to
the satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been misled, and thereupon the court may order
the pleading to be amended upon such terms as shall be just.
