When any executor or administrator shall fail to settle an account with any distributee or legatee of the estate he
represents, such distributee or legatee may institute his suit upon
the bond of such representative in the first instance, and may recover judgment against the principal and his sureties without a
suit against the executor or administrator in his representative
character.
