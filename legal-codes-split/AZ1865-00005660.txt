In case of the sickness, other disability, or necessary absence of
a justice on a return of a summons, or at the time appointed for a trial,
another justice of the same precinct or village may, at his request, attend
in his behalf, and shall thereupon become vested with the power, for the
time being, of the justice before whom the summons was returnable. In
that case the proper entry of the proceedings before the attending justice,
subscribed by him, shall be made in the docket of the justice before whom
the summons was returnable. If the case be adjourned, the justice before
whom the summons was returnable may resume jurisdiction.
