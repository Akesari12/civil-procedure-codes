1Pleadz'ngs on the part of plaintyf and defendant.

The pleadings on the part of the plaintifff shall be the complaint or demurrer to the defendant’s answer ; the pleadings
on the part of the defendant to the original complaint or cross
complaint of a co~defendant shall be the demurrer or answer.
When a defendant is entitled to relief as against the plaintifff
alone, or against the plaintill‘ and a co~defendant, he may
make a separate statement in his answer of the necessary
facts, with a prayer for the relief sought, instead of bringing

a distinct cross action. All pleadings subsequent to the _

original complaint shall be filed with the Clerk, and a copy
thereof served on the adverse party or his attorney, if the
adverse party or his attorney live within the county where
the action is pending; provided, that when the answer contains a cross complaint, the parties plaintifff or defendant, or
his or their attorney thereto, shall be served with a copy
thereof, and shall have the same time thereafter to plead
thereto that is allowed for pleading to the original complaint
after service of the summons.
