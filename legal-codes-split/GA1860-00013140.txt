All suits instituted as provided in this chapter, shall
be tried by a special jury at the first term of the court to which
the same may be returnable, unless continued as provided by this
Code in cases of appeal; and final judgment shall not be rendered, either for or against the defendant, until there shall be two
concurring verdicts, as in cases of divorce, as provided by this
Code; and the final judgment so rendered shall be deemed and
held by all the courts of this State, as conclusive upon the rights
and privileges of said defendant.
