The court or judge, for good cause, may appoint
a person to serve a particular process or order, who shall
have the same power to execute it, which the sheriff has.
The person may be appointed on the motion of the party
obtaining the process or order, and the return must be verified by affidavit. He shall be entitled to the fees allowed
to the sheriff for similar services.
