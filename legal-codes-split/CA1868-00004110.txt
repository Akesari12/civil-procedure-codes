Proceedings in the inferior Court may be stayed, or not.

If a stay of proceedingsâ€˜be not intended, the words requiring the stay shall be omitted from the writ; these words
may be inserted or omitted in the sound discretion of the
Court; but if omitted, the power of the inferior Court or
officer shall not be suspended, nor the proceedings stayed.
