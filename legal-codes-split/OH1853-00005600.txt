When a judgment, or final order shall be reversed,
either in whole or in part, in the district court, or supreme
court, the court reversing the same shall proceed to render
such judgment as the court below should have rendered, or
remand the cause to the court below for such judgment; and
the court reversing such judgment, or final order, shall not
issue execution in causes that are removed before them on
error, on which they pronounced judgment, as aforesaid, but
shall send a special mandate to the court below, as the case
may require, to award execution thereu on; and such court
to which such special mandate is sent, 8 all proceed in such
cases in the same manner as if such judgment, or final order,
had been rendered therein. And on motion, and good cause

shown, it may suspend any execution made returnable before
it by order of the district or supreme court, in the same manner as if such execution had been issued fromits own court,
but such power shall not extend further than to stay proceedings until the matter can be further heard by the district, or
supreme court, as the case may be.
