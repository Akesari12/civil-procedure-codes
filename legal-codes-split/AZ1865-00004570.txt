Whenever by the provisions of this chapter an oilâ€˜icer is
required to keep a person arrested on a warrant of attachment in custody,
and to bring him before a court or judge, the inability from illness or
otherwise of the person to attend shall be a suiiicient excuse for not
bringing him up; and the oilicer shall not confine a person arrested upon
the warrant in a prison, or otherwise restrain him of personal liberty,
except so far as may be necessary to secure his personal attendance.
