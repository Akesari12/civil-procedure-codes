When an execution against property of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors
I in the same judgment, shall be returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any
time after such return is made, shall be entitled to an order from a Judge of the Court, or a County
Judge of the Court in which the debtor resides, requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer
concerning his property before such judge, or a referee appointed by a Judge of the Court, at a time
and place specified in the order.
