As a general rule, the interest of a legatee or distributee is not the subject of garnishment issued against an executor
or administrator, but if the legacy has been assented to by the
executor, and such legacy is not defeated by debts against the
estate, and when there has has been a final settlement by the administrator, and there remains in his hands a fixed balance, such
legacy or the interest of the distributee, or heir, may be reached
by the process of garnishment, at the instance of a creditor of
such legatee, distributee, or heir at law, as the case may be.
