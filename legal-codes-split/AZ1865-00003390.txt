O.â€™ When a judgment is recovered against any one or more of several
persons jointly indebted upon an obligation, by proceedings, as provided
in section thirty-two, those who were not originally served with the summons, and did not appear to the action, may be summoned to show cause
why they should not be bound by the judgment, in the same manner as
though they had been originally served with the summons.
