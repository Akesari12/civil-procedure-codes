If an appeal is taken, and the transcript of the
record is not filed within the first three days of the court, it
is the duty of the court, on the motion of the appellee, to
affirm the judgment or decree of the court below, upon the
production by him of the certificate of the register, clerk, or
judge of the probate court, that an appeal has been taken to
the supreme court. For good cause shown, the court may
reinstate the cause during the term, on ayment of costs.
