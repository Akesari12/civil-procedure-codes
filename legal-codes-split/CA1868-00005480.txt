Ofer to compromise before trial.

If the defendant at any time before the trial, o&'er in writing
to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified sum,
the plaintifff may immediately have judgment therefore, with
the costs then accrued; but if he do not accept such offer
before the trial, and fail to recover in the action a sum equal
to the offer, he shall not recover costs, but costs shall be adjudged against him, and if he recover, deducted from his
recovery. But the offer and failure to accept it shall not be
given in evidence to affect the recovery otherwise than as to
costs, as above provided.
