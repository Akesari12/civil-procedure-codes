In cases Where suit is brought against joint obligors or
joint promissors, or other joint debtors, and in cases where the
Justice of the Peace is a party, and in cases where there is no
Justice in the district of the defendant’s residence—in all these
and like cases, the Constable of the district in which suit is brought
may serve all processes, on all the parties, and do all other legal
acts required of him in the progress of such suit, in any district
of the county.
