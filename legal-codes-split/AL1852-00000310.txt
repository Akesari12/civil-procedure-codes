If judgment be rendered against the state, it is the
duty of the comptroller, on the certificate of the clerk of the
court, together with that of the judge who tried the cause,
that the recovery was just, to issue his warrant for the
amount, but no certificate must issue until six months after
the recovery of judgment.
