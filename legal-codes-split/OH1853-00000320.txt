An executor, administrator, guardian, trustee of an
express trust, a person with whom, or in whose name, a contract is made for the benefit of another, or a person expressly
authorized by statute, may bring an action without joining
with him the person for whose benefit it is prosecuted. Officers may sue and be sued in such name as is authorized by
law, and official bonds may be sued upon in the same way.
