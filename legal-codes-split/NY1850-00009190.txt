When the verdict is given, and is such as the court may receive, the clerk must immediately record it in full in the minutes, and must read it to the jury and inquire of them whether it be their verdict. If any juror disagree, the fact must be entered in the minutes, and the jury again sent out; but if no disagreement be expressed, the verdict is complete, and the jury must be discharged from the case.
