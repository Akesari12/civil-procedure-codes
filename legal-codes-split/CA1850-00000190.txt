No action shall abate by the death, marriage, or other disability of a party, or by the transfer
of any interest therein, if the cause of action survive or continue. In case of death, marriage, or other
disability of a party, the Court on motion at any time within one year thereafter, or afterwards on a
supplemental complaint, may allow the action to be continued by or against his representative or
successor in interest. In case of any other transfer of interest, the action shall be continued in the
name of the original party, or the Court may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be
substituted in the action. '
