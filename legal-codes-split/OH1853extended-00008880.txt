Where any person who has become bail for stay
of execution, shall remove before the expiration of such
stay, into any other county or State, the justice shall, on
demand, issue execution against the goods and chattels of
the defendant, or other party against whom the original judgment was rendered, to be proceeded with as in other cases.
