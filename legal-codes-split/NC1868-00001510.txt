â€”Judge to explain law, but to express no opinions on facts.

No Judge, in giving a charge to the petty jury, shall give
an opinion whether a fact is fully or sufficiently proven,
such matter being the true oHice and province of the jury;
but he shall state in a plain and correct manner, the evidence given [in the case, and declare and explain the law
arising thereon. '
