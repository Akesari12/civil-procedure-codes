When a will shall be admitted to probate in the
probate court, or court of common pleas on appeal, any person interested shall have a right to contest its validity by
petition to the court of common pleas of the proper county,
and upon filing such petition the clerk of the court of common pleas shall certify that fact to the probate court in which
the will was admitted to probate.
