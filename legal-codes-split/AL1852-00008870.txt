If a seizure be made sixty days, or more, before
the return of the writ, and no stipulation be entered into
within five days thereafter, the sheriff must advertise and
sell the boat, or vessel, her tackle, ap arel, and furniture, for
cash, in the same manner as upon a evy by iieri facias, and
make return thereof to the next term of the court.
