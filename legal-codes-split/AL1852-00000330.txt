Two or more persons associated together as partners in any business or pursuit, who transact business under
a common name, whether it comprise the names of such persons or not, may be sued by their common name, and the
summons in such case being served on one or more of the
associates, the judgment in the action binds the joint property of all the associates, in the same manner as if all had
been named defendants, had been sued upon their joint
liability, and served with process; any one of the associates
or their legal representatives may also be sued for the obligation of all.
21-13. When two or more persons are jointly bound by
ju gment, bond, covenant, or promise in writing of any des- .
cription whatsoever, the obligation or promise is in law sev- ,
-eral as well as joint, and suit may be instituted thereon against .,
the legal re resentatives of such as are dead.
