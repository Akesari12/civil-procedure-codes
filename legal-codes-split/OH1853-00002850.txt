The verdict of a jury is either general or special.
A general verdict is that by which they pronounce, generally, upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the
plaintifff or defendant. A special verdict is that by which
the jury finds the facts only. It must present the facts as
establis ed by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove
them; and they must be so presented as that nothing remains to the court, but to draw from them conclusions of
law.
