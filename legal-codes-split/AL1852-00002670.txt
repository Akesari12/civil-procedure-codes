No objection must be allowed to the competency
of a witness in any legal proceeding, whether examined
orally or by deposition, because the witness has been rendered infamous by a conviction for any crime, (except perjury or subornation of peij ury), or because he is interested
in the event of the suit, or liable for costs, unless the verdict
and 'udgment would be evidence for him in another suit;
butt e objection for such cause goes to his credit only. This
section is not to be construed so as to authorize persons or
parties to be witnesses further than is authorized by the other
grpcvisions of this code, or to prevent any witness from being

' redited by proof that he is unworthy of belief in a court
of justice; nor must it change or qualify the mode or manner of establishin or proving the execution of conveyances
of property or W513, as regulated by this code.
