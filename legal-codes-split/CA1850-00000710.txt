The court may at any time, in furtherance of justice and on such terms as may be proper,
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of the party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting any other allegations
material to the cause, or by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer to be made, or other act to be done, after the time limited by
this Act, or by an order enlarge such time, and may also at any time within one year after notice
thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding taken against him through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and may supply an omission in any proceeding, and when
any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform in any respect to the provisions of this Act, the
Court shall have power to permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable to
law. '
