Whenever a vacancy shall occur in the office of
constable in any township by death, removal, resignation, or
non-acceptance of the person elected, or where there shall
be a failure to elect, the township trustees shall appoint a
suitable person to fill such vacancy until the next annual
election for constable, and until a successor be elected and
qualified.
