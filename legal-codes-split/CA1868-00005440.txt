Judgment for plaintgf by default.

When the defendant fails to appear and answer, judgment
shall be given for the plaintifff, as follows :

lst. When a copy of the account, note, bill, or other
obligation upon which the action is brought-, was filed with
the Justice at the time the summons was issued, judgment
shall be given without further evidence, for the sum specified
in the summons;

2d. In other cases, the Justice shall hear the evidence of
the plaintifff, and render judgment for such only sumas shall
appear by the evidence to be just ; but in no case exceeding

1. A judgment by default rendered in a J ustice’s Court cannot be attacked
collaterally as void for want of jurisdiction of the person of the defendant-—
who was a resident of the count , but not of the township in which the suit was
instituted—when there appears in the record a certificate, indorsed on the summons by the oiiiccr serving it, and filed with the Justice who acted on it, that
the summons was served on the defendant in the township in which suit was
commenced. Fagg v. C’le-ments, 16 Cal. 389.

2. Such certillcats is sutiicient,  facts, to establish the jurisdiction of
the Justice. The objection to the jurisdiction, that defendant did not reside in
the township where suit was brought, should have been taken at the trial ; and
as defendant failed to appear, the judgment is conclusive. Id.

3. Where a summons was issued and served in the morning, by which the
defendants were cited to appear and answer the complaint in the Court of First
Instance, at ten o’clock, and judgment was rendered against them at nine
o’clock in the morning of the same day : Held, that the judgment was irregular, and should be reversed; notwithstanding the Court olfered them permission to come in at a subsequent day and make their defense. Parlcer v. Sheppard, 1 Cal. 131.
