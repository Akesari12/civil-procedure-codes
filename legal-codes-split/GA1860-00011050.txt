The following shall be the oath of all special juries, to'
wit: “You shall well and truly try each cause submitted to you}
during the present term, and a true verdict give, according to the
law as given you in charge, and the opinion you entertain of the
evidence produced to you, to the best of your skill and knowledge,
without favor or affection to either party, provided you are not
discharged from the consideration of the case submitted. So help

you God”
