1. If the parties stipulate that a commissioner may take a deposition upon
written interrogatories, and the stipulation says nothing about the day the same
may be taken by the commissioner, it is not necessary that the commissioner

state in his certificate the day the same was taken. Elgin v. 11 ill, 27 Cal. 373.
