Manna of pleading a written instrument.
When the cause of action or counterclaim arises upon an

i account or instrument for the payment of money only, it shall

be sufficient for the party to deliver a copy of the account or
instrument to the Court, and to state that there is due to him

thereupon, from the adverse party, a specified-sum, which he
claims to recover or set off. The Court may, at the time of
the pleading, require that the original account or instrument
be exhibited to the inspection of the adverse party, and a
copy to be furnished; or if it be not so exhibited and a copy
furnished, may prohibit its being afterwards given in evidence.
