Competent evidence is that tvhich is admissible. Sufficient evidence is that which is satisfactory for the purpose.
Cumulative evidence is that which is additional to other already
obtained. Direct evidence is that which immediately points to
the question at issue. Indirect, or circumstantial evidence is
that which only tends to establish the issue, by proof of various
facts, sustaining by their consistency, the hypothesis claimed.
Presumptive evidence consists of inferences drawn by human
experience from the connection of cause and effect, and observations of human conduct.
