All special juries shall be taken from the grand jury,
and shall be stricken in the presence of the court in the following
manner: the Clerk shall furnish a list of the grand jurors present
and then impannelled, from which the parties or their attorneys
may strike out one alternately, until there shall be but twelve left,
who shall be forthwith empannelled and sworn as special jurors;
in cases of appeal by consent the plaintifff shall strike first, and
in all other cases the appellant shall strike first, and should either
party fail or refuse to strike such special jury, after being notified
or required so to do, the presiding Judge shall, in behalf of the
party so failing or refusing to stike, proceed in the same way
and manner as if the party failing or refusing were striking said
special jury in person, or consenting to the same.
