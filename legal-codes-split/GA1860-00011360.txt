When any jury is confined in the investigation of a
case for a length of time which exposes them to hunger and cold,
the Court may, on application from such jury, direct them to be
furnished with such refreshments as the presiding Judge may
deem meet and proper, and the said Judge shall have full power
to draw his warrant on the County Treasurer of the county where
the investigation is had, for the payment of the same, which the
said Treasurer shall pay out of any funds on hand. The Judge
may also allow the jury fire if the circumstances require it.
