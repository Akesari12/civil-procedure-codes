Whenever any party to an action who holds a lien upon the
preperty, or any part thereof, has other securities for the payment of the
amount of such lien, the court may, in its discretion, order such securities
to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or may order

a just deduction to be made from the amount of the lien on the property
on account thereof.
