A seal is not necessary to convey the legal title

,to land, to enable the grantee to sue at law. Any instru*ment in writing, signed by the grantor or his agent, having

a written authority, is effectual to transfer the legal title to

â€™the grantee, if such was the intention of the grantor, to be

collected from the entire instrument.
