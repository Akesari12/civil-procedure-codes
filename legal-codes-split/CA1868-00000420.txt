Answer in such cases.

In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant
may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged
as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances to reduce the
amount of damages; and whether he prove the justification

or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
N. Y. Code, § 165 ; Abb. Forms, 1023-1036.

1. Justification. what must be a1leged.—To constitute a jnstincation in
an action for libel, the answer must aver the truth of the defamatory matter
charged. It is not sumcient to set up facts which only tend to establish the
truth of such matter. Without an averment of its truth, the fact detailed

can only avail in mitigation of damages. Thrall v. Smiley, 9 Cal. 529.

2. lEal1ce.—It is error for the Court to instruct the jury “that when a
n injuriously slanders the title of another, malice is presumed.” McDanv. Baca, 2 Cal. 326.

3. Proof by defendant.—The defendant may prove the ly by plaintit
immigigtflly after defendant uttered the slanderous words. v. Gardner, . 371.
