Judgment may be given for or against one or more of several plaintiffih, and for or against one
or more of several defendants, and it may determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each side as
between themselves. In an action against several defendants, the court may, in its discretion, render
judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against the others whenever a
several judgment may be proper. The court may also dismiss the complaint, with costs in favor of one
or more defendants, in case of unreasonable neglect on the part of the plaintiE' to have the summons
served on other defendants, or to proceed in the cause against the defendant or defendants served.
