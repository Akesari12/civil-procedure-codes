Each coroner is entitled to receive for his services in holding an inquest and performing any other duty incidental thereto, such compensation as maybe fixed by the board of supervisors of his county; and can receive for those services no other compensation or fees whatever. In the city and county of New-York, the compensation so fixed, must be an annual salary.
