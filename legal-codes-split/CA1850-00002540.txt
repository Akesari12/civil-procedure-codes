of a witness, he may file interrogatories in the District Court of any county in which any person to be
afiected by the testimony resides, or is found, and may have notice served on such person, and may
proceed in all respects as is provided in this chapter in regard to the taking of the answers of a witness
out of the court. When executed, the commission shall be returned to and remain filed in the court
from which it issued. In any action in any Court of this State, between the person tiling the
interrogatories and any person to whom notice has been given or prescribed in this chapter, the testimony
of the witness so examined may be used in evidence subject to the same exceptions which might be
made if the answers were taken in an action pending at the time: Provided, that the witness he not at
the time of the trial a resident of the county in which the action is tried.
