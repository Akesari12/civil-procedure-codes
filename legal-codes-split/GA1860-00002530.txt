In bail cases sounding in damages the sum sworn to

need not be endorsed upon the back of the writ, nor is it necessary

that the afiiant should swear to any particular sum as damages,
{but must state the facts as to the nature and extent of the injury
which he has sustained;_ but it is no objection that the sum for
which the Sheriff is directed to take bail differs from that claimed
in the declaration.
