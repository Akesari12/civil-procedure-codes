If the return denies the custody or detention of the
party, it shall further state, distinctly, the latest date at which the
custody was had, and when and to whom transferred, and if it

shall appear that such transfer of custody was made to avoid the

writ of habeas corpus, the party making the return may be imprisoned in the discretion of the Judge or Justices hearing the same,
until the body of the party kept or detained shall be produced.
