The court shall make proper orders for the preservation of the property, during the pendency of the suit. It
may direct a sale of property, when, because of its perishable nature or the costs of keeping it, a sale will be for
the benefit of the parties. In vacation, such sale may be

ordered by the judge of the court. The sale shall be public,
after such advertisement as is prescribed for the sale of like
property on execution, and shall be made in such manner
and upon such terms of credit, with security, as the court or
judge, having regard to the probable duration of the action,
may direct. The proceeds, if collected by the sheriff, with
all the monies received by him from garnishees, shall be
held and paid over by him, under the same requirement and
responsibilities of himself and sureties, as are provided in
respect to money deposited in lieu of bail.
