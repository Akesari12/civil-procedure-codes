If the execution be for the delivery of the possession of real property, it shall require the officer to deliver
the same, particularly describing the property, to the party
entitled thereto, and may at the same time require the officer
to satisfy any costs or damages recovered in the same judgment, out of the goods and chattels of the party against
whom it was rendered, and for the want of such goods and
chattels, then out of the lands and tenements, and in this
respect it shall be deemed an execution against the proe .
p $188. When the judgment is not for the recovery of
money or real property, the same may be enforced by
attachment by the court rendering judgment, upon motion
made, or by a rule of the court upon the defendant; but in
either case notice of the motion, or a service of a copy of
the rule shall be made on the defendant a reasonable time,
before the order of attachment is made.
