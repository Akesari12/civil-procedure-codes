The trial of an issue of fact, and the assessment
of damages in any case, shall be in the order in which they
are placed on the trial docket, unless by consent of the parties, or the order of the court, they are continued or placed
at the heel of the docket. The time of hearing all other
cases shall be in the order in which they are placed on the
docket, unless the court in its discretion shall otherwise
direct. The court may in its discretion hear at any time a
motion, and may by rule prescribe the time for hearing

motions.
