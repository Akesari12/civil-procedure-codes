If, after the empannelling of the jury, and before verdict, a ,
juror become sick, so as to be unable to perform his duty, the'court may
order him to be discharged. In that case the trial may proceed with the
other jurors, or a new jury may be sworn, and the trial begin anew; or
the jury may be discharged, and a new jury then or afterwards empannelled.
