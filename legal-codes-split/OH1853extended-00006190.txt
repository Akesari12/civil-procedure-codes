Whenever a peremptory mandamus is directed to
any public officer, body or board, commanding the performance of any public duty, pecially enjoined by law, if it appear to the court, that such officer, or any member of such
body, or board, has, without just excuse, refused or neglected
to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a fine
not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon every such officer
or member of such body or board. Such fine, when collected,
shall be paid into the treasury of the county, where the duty
ought to have been performed; and the payment thereof, is a
bar to an action for any penalty incurred by such officer, or
member of such body or board, by reason of his refusal or
neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.
