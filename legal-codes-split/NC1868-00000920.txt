have power to adjudge and direct the payment by the mort'gagor of any residue of the mortgage debt that may remain
unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged premises, in cases
in which the mortgagor shall be personally liable for the
debt secured by such mortgage; and if the mortgage debt
‘ be secured by the convenant or obligation of any person
other than the mortgagor, the plaintifff may make such person a party to the action, and the court may adjudge payment of the residue of such debt remaining unsatisfied after
a sale of the mortgaged premises, against such other person,
and may enforce such' judgment as in other cases.
