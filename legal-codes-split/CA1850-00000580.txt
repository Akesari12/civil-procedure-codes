It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein
alleged ; but he shall deliver to the adverse party within five days after a demand thereof in writing, a
copy of the account, verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect that he
believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The Judge may order a further or
a more particular bill.
