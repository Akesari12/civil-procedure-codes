Whilst grand jurors are bound only to notice or make
presentments of such offenses as may or shall come to their knowledge or observation after they shall have been sworn, yet, they
have the right and power, and it is their duty, as jurors, to make
presentments of any violations of the laws which they may know
to have been committed at any previous time, which are not
barred by the statute of limitations.
