If the defendant is confined in the penitentiary or
common jail, so that he cannot be delivered up by the bail,
if the bail give notice in writing to the plaintiii of the fact of
such imprisonment and that he desires to surrender his principal, it is in law a surrender and discharge of the bond; and
on notice being given by the plaintifff to the jailor or warden
of the penitentiary, the defendant must not be 
from confinement at the ex iration of his term of imprisonment, but must be delivere up to the sheriff of the court in
which the cause is pending, who must retain him in custody
until discharged by due course of law. But if not demanded
within three da s after such convict is entitled to his discharge, he must he set at liberty.
