If a purchaser refuse to pay the amount bid by him for property struck off to him at a sale under execution, the officer may again sell
the property at any time to the highest bidder, and if any loss be occasioned
thereby, the officer may recover the amount of such loss, with costs, by
motion upon previous notice of five days before any court, or before any
justice of the peace, if the same shall not exceed his jurisdiction.
