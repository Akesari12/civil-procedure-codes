If a stipulation be entered into, the stipulators are
de endants to the action; and if the claim he established,
judgment must be rendered against them and their sureties. If
there be no stipulation entered into, the court must proceed
and render judgment ex parte, condemning the boat, its tackle,
apparel, and furniture, to be sold for the satisfaction of the
c aim of the complainants; and the affidavit of the complainant is presumptive evidence of the justice of the demand.
