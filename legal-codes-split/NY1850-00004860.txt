A sheriff or other officer who has arrested a person in one county, may pass through such, parts of another county or counties, as are in the usual route of travel, from the place where the prisoner was arrested, to that to which he is to be conveyed and delivered. And neither the prisoner nor the officer having him in custody, can be arrested on civil process, while passing through any other county than that in which the arrest was made.
