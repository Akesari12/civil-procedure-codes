‘ jury shall find a balance for the defendant, such defendant may:

enter up judgment for the amount, and take out execution in
such manner as plaintifffs may do by this Code; provided such
defendant shall, at the time of filing his answer, file therewith a
true copy or copies of the subject matter of such sets-off; and
where the plaintifff shall be indebted to the defendant on open
account for dealings between themselves, and where the defen-.
dant shall hold and possess in his own right, by assignment,j
endorsement, or otherwise, according to law, any bond, note,
bill, or other writing for money, or other thing, of the plaintifff ’s,
such defendant may offer the same as set-off, and on due proof
shall be allowed the same.
