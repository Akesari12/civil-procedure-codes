A defendant in a civil action, can be arrested
before, and after judgment, in the manner prescribed by
this code, and not otherwise; but this provision does not
apply to proceedings for contempt; nor does it apply to
actions or judgments prosecuted in the name of the State
of Ohio, to recover fines or penalties for crimes, misdemeanors, or offenses.
