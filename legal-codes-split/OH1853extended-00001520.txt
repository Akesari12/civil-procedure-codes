When the plaintifff shall be ignorant of the name
of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any
pleading or proceeding by any name and description, and
when his true name is discovered, the pleading, or proceeding may be amended accordingly. The plaintifff in such
case, must state, in the verification of his petition, that he.
could not discover the true name, and the summons must
contain the words, “real name unknown,” and a copy
thereof must be served personally upon the defendant.
