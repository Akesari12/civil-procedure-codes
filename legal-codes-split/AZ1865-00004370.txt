may move for a new trial upon a statement prepared as provided in section
195. The motion for a new trial may, upon reasonable notice, be brought

or vacation. If a new trial be granted, the jury shall, within five days
thereafter, unless the parties agree on a longer time, be summoned to try

the issue. After a second verdict in favor of the same party, a new trial
shall not be had. a
