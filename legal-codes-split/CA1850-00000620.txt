In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to
state the facts showing the performance ; but it may be stated generally, that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part; and if such allegations be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound
to establish on the trial the facts showing such performance.
