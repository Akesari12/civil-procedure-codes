Whenever it shall satisfactorily appear to the grand
jury of any county in this State, that the Receiver of Tax Returns
has committed an error in making an entry in his digest, of either
quantity or quality of property returned in such digest, or in the
amount of taxes assessed, such grand jury may recommend the Inferior Court of their county and the Comptroller General of the
State, to cause such error (particularly specifying the same) to be
corrected.
