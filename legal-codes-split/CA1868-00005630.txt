the docket of his predecessor.

Any Justice with whom thetdocket of his predecessor is
deposited shall have and exercise over all actions and proceedings entered in the docket of his predecessor, the same
jurisdiction as if originally commenced before him. In
case of the creation of a new county, or the change of the
boundary between two counties, any Justice into whose
hands the docket of a Justice formerly acting as such within
the same territory may come, shall for the purposes of this

section, be considered the successor of said former Justice.
