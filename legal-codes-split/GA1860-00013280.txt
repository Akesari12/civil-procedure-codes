If the party complained against shall fail to give the
bond provided for in the preceding section, the said Justice of
the Inferior Court shall cause the said person of color to be de
livered to the party making the affidavit and complaint, upon his
giving bond, with good security, payable to the party complained
against, in a sum equal to what said person of color would be
worth if he were a slave, conditioned for the delivery of the person of color, and the payment of his hire to the pretended owner;
Provided, it shall appear upon the trial of the suit for freedom,
that such person is a slave, and is not illegally held in slavery.
