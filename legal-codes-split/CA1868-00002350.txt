‘ W7zen unequal partition is ordered, compensation may
be adjudged in certain cases.

When it appears that partition cannot be made equal between the parties, according to their respective rights, without
prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, and a
partition be ordered, the Court may adjudge compensation to
be made by one party to another, on account of the inequality;
but such compensation shall not be required to be made to
others by owners unknown, nor by an infant, unless it shall
appear that such infant has personal property sufficient for that
purpose, and that his interest will be promoted thereby. And
in all cases the Court shall have power to make compensatory
adjustment between the respective parties, according to the
ordinary principles of equity.

‘Amended 1866, 706.
