In all cases of reference the parties as to whom issues are
formed in the action (except when the defendant is an infant
or an absentee) may agree in writing upon a person or
persons, not exceedingihree, and a reference shall be ordered
to him or them, and to no other person, or persons. And

if such parties do not agree, the court shall appoint one or
more referees, not more than three, who shall be free from

whom all parties in the action shall object, except in actions
for divorce. And no Judge or J usti'ce of any court shall sit
as referee in any action pending in the court of which he is
Judge or Justice, and not already referred, unless the
parties otherwise stipulate. The referee or referees shall
make and deliver a report within sixty days from the time
the action shall be finally submitted; and in default thereof,
and before the report is delivered, either party may serve
notice upon the Opposite party that he elects to end the

no reference had been Ordered, and the. referees shall not in

such case be entitled to any fees.

The report of the referee shall be made to the clerk of the
court in which the action is pending: either party after ten
days notice to the adverse party, may move the Judge to
review such report, and set aside, modify, or confirm the
same in whole or in part, and no judgment shall be entered
on any reference except by order of the Judge.
