A schedule filed by an insolvent debtor is amendable,
provided he will show to the satisfaction of the court, by affidavit
or otherwise, that the omission arose from ignorance, inadver~
tance, mistake, or inability at the time to make it more perfect;
he must, however, amend instant‚Äù, and will not be permitted to
delay a creditor thereby.
