If execution shall not be sued out within five
years from the date of any judgment, that now is or may
hereafter be rendered in any court of record in this State, or
if five years shall have intervened between the date of the
last execution issued on such judgment and the time of suing
out another writ of execution thereon, such judgment shall
become dormant, and shall cease to operate as a lien on the
estate of the judgment debtor.
