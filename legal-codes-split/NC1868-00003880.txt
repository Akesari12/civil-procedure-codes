The defendant may, on the return of process and before
answering, make an offer in writing to allow judgment to
be taken against him for an amount, to be stated in such
offer, with costs. The plaintifff shall thereupon, and before
any other proceeding be had in the action, determine _
whether he will accept or reject such offer. If he accept
the offer, and give notice thereof in writing, the Justice shall
file the offer and the acceptance thereof, and render judgment accordingly. If notice of acceptance be not given,
and if the plaintifff fail to obtain judgment for a greater
amount, exclusive of costs, than has been specified in the
offer, he shall not recover costs, but shall pay to the defendant his costs accruing subsequent to the offer. â€˜
