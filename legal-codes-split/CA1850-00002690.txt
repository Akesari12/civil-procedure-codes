or order shall not be stayed by appeal, unless a written undertaking be entered into on the part of the
appellant, by at least two sureties, and in such amount as the District Judge or one of the Justices of
the Supreme Court shall, on notice to the respondent of at least one day, direct, that the appellant will
obey the judgment or order of the Supreme Court upon the appeal.
