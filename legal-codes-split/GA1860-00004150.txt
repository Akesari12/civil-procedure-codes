In allowing or refusing amendments there is a wide
discretion to be exercised by the court, hence no fixed rule can
be laid down which would apply to each particular case that
might arise, but as a general rule, the court will amend the entries
of its orders on the minutes, or the records and other proceedings,
mmcpro tune: â€˜

1. When the case is within some statutory provisions.

2. When there is something on the face of the proceedings to
amend by, from which what actually took place in the prior proceedings can be clearly ascertained and known.

3. In all cases where such amendment will clearly be in furtherance of justice.
