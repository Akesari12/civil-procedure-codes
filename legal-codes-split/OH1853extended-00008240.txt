When the arbitrators shall convene and be qualified, they shall proceed to hear and determine the cause, and
make out their award in writing, which shall be valid when
signed by any two of them, and return the same to the justice ; who shall thereupon enter such award on his docket,
and thereon render judgment and issue execution, as in other
cases.
