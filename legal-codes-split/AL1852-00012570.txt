It is no objection to the execution of a decree
rendered against a defendant, that it was founded on a bill
taken pro confesso without personal service; but before the
execution of such decree, the plaintifff or party interested,
must give bond with two sureties, payable to and approved
by the register, in a penalty to be prescribed by the chancellor or such register, conditioned to ay the pecuniary value
of the personal property which may e disposed of, or placed

beyond the control of the court or party, by the execution
of the decree, and interest thereon from the time such property is so disposed of or placed beyond such control; and to
account for the value, rents and rofits of any real estate
transferred by the operation of sue decree; and further to
abide and perform such decree, as the court may render, if
the decree taken on the bill pro confesso is set aside; and
the chancellor may, if such decree is set aside, render a final
decree against all the parties to such bond.
» § 2950. Where personal service of a decree rendered under the provisions of this cha ter, is made by serving the
defendant with a copy of such ecree, the same is conclusive
and binding on him, if the petition to set aside such decree
‘is not made within six months from such service.
