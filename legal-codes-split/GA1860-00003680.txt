A trespasser cannot set off improvements in an action'
brought for mesne proâ€™dts, except when the value of the premises}
has been increased by the repairs or improvements which have:
been made. In that case, the jury may take into consideration
the improvement or repairs, and diminish the profits by that
amount, but not below the sum which the premises would have
been worth without such improvements or repairs.
