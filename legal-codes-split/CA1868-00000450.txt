17 he Court may enlarge time to plead, correct mistakes,
amend and relieve from judgments in certain cases, etc.

The Court may, in furtherance of justice, and on such
terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceedings
by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect, and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for
an answer or demurrer, or demurrer to an answer filed. The
Court may likewise, upon affidavit showing good cause therefore, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon such terms
as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding
in other particulars, and may, upon like terms, allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this Act; and
may, upon such terms as may be just, and upon payment of
costs, relieve a party or his legal representatives from a

judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against him
through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect; and when, for any cause satisfactory to the Court,
or the Judge at chambers, the party aggrieved has been unable to apply for the relief sought during the term at which
such judgment, order, or proceeding complained of was taken,
the Court, or the Judge at chambers in vacation, may grant
the relief upon application made within a reasonable time,
not exceeding five months after the adjournment of the term.
When, from any cause, the summons and a copy of the complaint in an action have not been personally served on the
defendant, the Court may allow, on such terms as may be
just, such defendant or his legal representatives, at any time
within six months after the rendition of any judgment in
such action, to answer to the merits of the original action.
