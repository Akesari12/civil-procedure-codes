A former recovery, or the pendency of a former suit
for the same cause of action, between the same parties, in the
same or any other court that has jurisdiction, shall be a good
cause of abatement; but if the first action is so defective that
no recovery can be possibly had, the pendency of a former suit
will not abate the action.
