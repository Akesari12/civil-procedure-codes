If any person desires to perpetuate the testimony of a
witness, in anticipation of litigation, not yet pending, and which
it is not in his power to commence, he may make written application to the Judge of the Superior Court of the county where
the witness resides, or if a non-resident, where he may be temporarily, stating the facts, the proof expected, and the parties probably interested on the other side, accompanying such application
with the written interrogatories to be propounded to the witness,
whereupon the Judge shall pass an order requiring some disinterested attorney of the court to act as commissioner and take
such testimony, providing in such order for the most effectual
notice to the opposite parties, and for â€˜any cross interrogatories
which may be filed.
