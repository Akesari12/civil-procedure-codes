L No appeal shall be allowed in collateral issues ordered
by the court; but the Superior Court may, in its discretion, grant
a new trial upon such terms as shall appear reasonable and just;
and when such collateral issue is tried in the Inferior Court, if
said court is dissatisfied with the verdict, they may permit an appeal to the Superior Court, at their discretion.
