If the defendant any time before trial offer in
writing to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified sum, the plaintifff may immediately have judgment
therefore with the costs then accrued. But if he do not accept such offer before the trial, and fail to recover in the action a sum equal to the offer, he cannot recover costs accrued after the offer; but costs must be adjudged against
him. But the offer and failure to accept it cannot be given
in evidence to affect the recovery otherwise than as to costs
as above provided.
