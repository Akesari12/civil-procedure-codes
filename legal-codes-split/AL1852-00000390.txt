Suit may be brought on a bond, note, bill of exfchange, or other mercanfile instrument, which has been lost,
or destroyed by accident, and if affidavit be made b the
plaintifff of such loss and destruction, and the contents ereof; and that the same has not been paid, or otherwise discharged, and accompanies the complaint, it must be received
as presumptive evi ence both of the contents, and loss or
destruction of such instrument; unless the defendant, b
plea, verified by aiiidavit, denies the execution of such bonti

note, or bill, or the indorsement, acceptance, or the contents
thereof; in which case proof of such execution, indorsement,
acceptance, or contents, must be made by the plaintifff; but
this section must not be so construed as to authorize a suit
for the recovery of a note or bill issued by an incorporated
bank to pass as money, and alleged to be lost or destroyed.
When the suit is against an executor or administrator, he
may controvert the oath of the plaintifff of the loss, destruction, or contents of the instrument sued on, by swearing to
the best of his knowledge and belief.
