When the amount due to either party exceeds the
sum for which the justice is authorized to enter judgment,
such party may remit the excess and judgment may be entered for the residue. A defendant need not remit such excess, and may withhold setting the same off, and a recovery
â€˜for the amount set off and allowed, or any part thereof, shall
not be a bar to his subsequent action for the amount withheld.
