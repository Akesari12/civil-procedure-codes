If the term of service of the sheriff, or other officer, who has made, or shall hereafter make sale of any lands
and tenements, shall expire ; or if the sheriff, or other officer
shall be absent, or be rendered unable by death, or otherwise, to make a deed of conveyance of the same, any succeeding sheriff, or other officer, on receiving a certificate
from the court from which execution issued for the sale of
said lands and tenements, signed by the clerk, by order of
said court, setting forth that sufficient proof has been made
to the court, that such sale was fairly and legally made ; and,
on tender of the purchase money, or if the same, or any part
thereof be paid, then, on proof of such payment and tender
of the balance, if any, may execute to the said purchaser, or
purchasers, or his or their legal representatives, a deed of
conveyance of the said lands and tenements so sold. Such
deed shall be as good and valid in law, and have the same
effect, as if the sheriff, or other officer, who made the sale,

had executed the same.
