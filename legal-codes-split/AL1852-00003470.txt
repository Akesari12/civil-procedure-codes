Charges moved for by either party, must be in
writing, and must be given or refused, in the terms in which
they are written; and it is the duty of the judge to write,
“given,” or “refused,” as the case may be, on the document,
and sign his name thereto; which thereby becomes a part of
the record, and may be taken by the jury with them on their
retirement.
