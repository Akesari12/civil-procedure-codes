At any time before the stay shall expire, if the

â€˜ justice taking the surety, or his successor in office, shall
become satisfied that the surety is insufficient, it shall be his
duty to cause written notice thereof to be given to the defendant, or if he be absent, that the same be left at his residence, requiring him to give additional surety. If such
defendant shall not have given such additional surety, on
or by the third day after the giving of such notice, such fact
shall be entered on the docket, and he shall immediately
issue execution against the defendant for the collection of
the judgment. If within ten days after the issuing of such
execution, surety to the satisfaction of the justice be given,
the execution shall be recalled and stayed until the expiration of the original stay.
