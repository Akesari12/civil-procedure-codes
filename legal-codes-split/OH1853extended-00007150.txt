The probate judge shall thereupon administer to the
jury the following oath or affirmation: “ You do solemnly
swear ” [or “you do solemnly affirm,” as the case may be,]
“ that you [will] well and truly try the issue between the State
of Ohio, and the defendant, and a true verdict give according
to law and evidence. So help you God.”
