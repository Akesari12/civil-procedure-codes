If redundant or irrelevant matter be inserted in
any pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of the party
prejudiced thereby. And when the allegations of a pleading
are so indefinite and uncertain, that the precise nature of

the charge or defense is not apparent, the Court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by
amendment. .
