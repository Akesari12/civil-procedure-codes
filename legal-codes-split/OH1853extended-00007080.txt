When the defendant is acquitted, either by the
probate judge or by a jury, he-shall be immediately discharged; and if the probate judge certify in his minutes, that
the prosecution was malicious or without probable cause, he
may order the prosecutor to pay the costs of the proceedings,
and enter up judgment therefore, which may be enforced by
execution.
