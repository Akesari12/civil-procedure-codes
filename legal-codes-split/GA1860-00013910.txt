In all cases where a tenant shall hold possession of
|lands or tenements, over and beyond the term for which the same
were rented or leased to him, and in all cases where lands or tenements shall be held and occupied by any tenant at will or sufferance, whether under contract of rent or not, and the owner of
the lands or tenements shall desire the possession of the same,
such owner may, by himself, his agent or attorney in fact, or attorney at law, demand the possession of the property so rented,
leased, held, or occupied, and if the tenant refuses or omits to deliver possession when so demanded, the owner, his agent, or attorney at law, or attorney in fact, may go before the Judge of
the Superior Court, or any one of the Justices of the Inferior
Court, or any Justice of the Peace, and make oath of the facts.
