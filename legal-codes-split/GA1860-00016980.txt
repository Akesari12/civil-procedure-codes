If the Judge shall determine that the bill of exceptions
is not true, or does not contain all the necessary facts, he shall return the sameâ€™ within ten days to the party, or his attorney, with
his objections to the same in writing. If these objections are
met and removed, the Judge may then certify, specifying in his
certificate the cause of the delay. If the Judge sees pr0per, he
may order noticevto the opposite party of the fact and time of
tendering the exceptions, and may hear evidence as to the truth
thereof. '
