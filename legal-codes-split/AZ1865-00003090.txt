When the party who has the right to appeal wishes a statement
of the case to be annexed to the record of the judgment or order, he shall,
within twenty days after the entry of such judgment or order, prepare such
statement, which shall, contain the grounds upon which he intends to rely
on the appeal, and so much of the evidence as may be necessary to explain
the grounds, and no more, and shall serve a copy thereof upon the adverse
party. The respondent may, within five days thereafter, prepare amendments to the statement, and serve a copy on the appellant. If such amendments are admitted the statement shall be corrected accordingly; and if
not admitted, the statement and amendment shall be presented to the judge
who tried or heard the case, upon notice of two days to the respondent,
and a true statement shall thereupon be settled by such judge.
