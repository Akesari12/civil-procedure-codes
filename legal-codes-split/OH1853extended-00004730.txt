In all cases where judgment is rendered in any
court of record within this State, upon any other instrument
of writing, in which two or more persons are jointly and
severally bound, and it shall be made to appear to the
court, by parol or other testimony, that one or more of said
persons so bound, signed the same as surety or bail for his
or their co-defendant, it shall be the duty of the clerk of
said court, in recording the judgment thereon, to certify
which of the defendants is principal debtor, and which are
sureties or bail. And the clerk of the court aforesaid, shall
issue execution on such judgment, commanding the sheriff
or other officer, to cause the money to be made of the goods
and chattels, lands and tenements, of the principal debtor,
but for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor, to
make the same, that he cause the same to be made of the
goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the surety or
bail. In all cases, the property, both personal and real, of the
principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the court, shall be
exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail
shall be taken in execution.
