The defendant may, at any time before judgment
after reasonable notice to the plaintifff, move the court for
additional security on the part of the plaintifff ; and if, on
such motion, the court is satisfied that the surety in the plaintifff â€™s undertaking has removed from this State, or is not sufficient for the amount thereof, it may vacate the order of
attachment and direct restitution of any property taken under
it, unless in a reasonable time to be fixed by the court, sufficient security is given by the plaintifff.
