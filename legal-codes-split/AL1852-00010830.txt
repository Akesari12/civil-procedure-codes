When an attachment or execution is levied by a
constable on personal property claimed by any person not a
party to the writ, he may try the right to sue pro erty by
making affidavit that he has a just title thereto, ang executing bond in double the amount of the plaintifff ’s demand,
payable to the plaintifff, with sufficient surety, tobe approved

y the constable, with condition to have the property forthcoming for the satisfaction of the plaintifff ’s judgment, if it
be found liable therefore, and for the payment of such costs
and damages as may be recovered for putting in the claim
for delay; and thereupon the property must be restored to
the person from whom it was taken.
