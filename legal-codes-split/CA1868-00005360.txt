‘Adjournment not to exceed four months, for same
cause.

An adjournment may be had, either at the time of joining
issue, or at any subsequent time to which the case may
stand adjourned, on application of either party, for a period
longer than ten days, but not to exceed four months, from
the time of the return of the summons, upon proof by the
oath of the party, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the
Justice, that such party cannot be ready for trial before
the time to which he desires an adjournment, for want of
material evidence, particularly describing it, and that the
delay has not been made necessary by any act or negligence
on his part since the action was commenced; that he has
used due diligence to procure the evidence, and has been
unable to do so, and that he expects to procure the evidence
at the time stated by him: provided, that if the adverse
party admit that such evidence would be given, and consent
that it may be considered as given on the trial, or offered

or overruled as improper, the adjournment shall not be had.
‘Amended 1854, 96.
