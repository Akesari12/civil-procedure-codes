This title shall not apply to actions already commenced, or to cases where the right of action has already

to such cases, according to the subject of the action, and

without regard to the form; nor shall this title apply in
the case of a continuing and subsisting trust, or to an
action by a vendee of real property, in possession thereof,
to obtain a conveyance of it.
