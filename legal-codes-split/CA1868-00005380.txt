Failure of either party to appear, ejects of.

[1867-8.] If either party shall fail to appear at the time
fixed for trial, or at the time to which the trial has been
adjourned, the trial may proceed at the request of the adverse party, and judgment shall be rendered in conformity
with the pleadings and proofs.

587. Trial by jury. Summoning jurors.

A trial by jury shall be demanded at the time of joining
issue; and shall be deemed waived if neither party then demand it. When demanded, the trial of the case shall be
adjourned, until a time and place fixed for the return of the
jury. If neither party desire an adjournment, the time and
place shall be determined by the Justice, and shall be on
the same day, or within the next two days. The jury shall
be summoned upon an order of the Justice, from the citizens of the city or township, and not from the bystanders.
