When the purchaser of any goods or chattels shall pay the purchase money, the officer
selling the same shall deliver him the property, and if desired, shall execute an instrument of writing,
drawn and delivered to him at the expense of the purchaser, setting forth the sale and payment of the
purchase money, and conveying to the purchaser all the right, title, and interest which the debtor had
in and to the property sold on the day the execution was levied.
