If, after being arrested, the defendant escape or be rescued, or bail be not given or justified, or
a deposit be not made instead thereof, the Sheriff shall himself be liable as bail ; but he may discharge
himself from such liability, by the giving and justification of bail, as provided in this chapter, at any
time before process against the person of the defendant, to enforce an order or judgment in the action.
