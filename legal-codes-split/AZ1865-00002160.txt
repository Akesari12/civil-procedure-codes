When an execution against property of the judgment debtor,
or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to the sheriff
of the county where he resides, or if he do not reside in this Territory, to

 

the sheriff of the county where the judgment-roll is filed, is returned unsa- ~
tislied in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time after such
return is made, shall be entitled to an order from the judge of the court,
requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning his
property before such judge, or a referee appointed by him, at a time and
place specified in the order ; but no judgment debtor shall be required to
attend before a judge or referee out of the county in which he resides,
when proceedings are taken under the provisions of this chapter.
