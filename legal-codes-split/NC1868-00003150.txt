,—Books to be furnished by Secretary of State, and to be indexed.

The books required to be kept by the last section must be
furnished to the Judge of Probate by the Secretary of‘State;
and to each of such books there must be attached an alphabetical index securely bound in the volume, referring to
the entries therein by the page of the book. These books
must, at all proper times, be open to the inspection of any
person.
