If property is levied on by a constable under an
execution from another county, and the property is not delivered on the day of sale according to the forthcoming bond,
the constable must return the bond “forfeited” to any justice
of his county, together with a copy of the execution, who
must proceed thereon in the same manner as if judgment had
been rendered by him; and the constable must then return
the execution to the justice that issued it, with an indorsement, showing the levy and forfeiture of the bond.
