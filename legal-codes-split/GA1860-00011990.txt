La mortgage on personal property, as hereinbefore directed. the
mortgagor, or his special agent, may file his aiiidavit of illegality
to such execution, in which afhdavit he may set up and avail
himself of any defense which he might have set up according to
law, in an ordinary suit upon the demand secured by the mort—

due.

. §3880. When an aiiidavit of illegality shall be filed to a mortgage execution, as provided for in the preceding section, the
Judge or Justice who passed the order of the foreclosure, may
order the levying oiiicer to postpone the sale of the mortgaged
property upon the mortgagor, or his special agent ora ttorney,
giving bond with good and suiiicient security, in double the
amount of such execution, conditioned for the return of such

where the questions and issues shall be tried as other cases of
illegality; and the jury shall be sworn to give at least twentyfive per cent. damages to the plaintifff on the principal sum, in
