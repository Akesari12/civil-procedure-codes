At any stage in the progress of an equity cause, if any
portion of the same is ready for, or requires a decree, the court
may hear and determine such matters and pass such interlocutory decree or order as may advance the cause and expedite a final
hearing. If no issue of fact is involved, the verdict of a jury is
unnecessary.
