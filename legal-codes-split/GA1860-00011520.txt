The officer called on by rule 115 32', as provided in the
preceding section, shall fully respond in writing to said rule,
which answer shall be under oath, taken at the time the answer
is filed ; and if the answer is not denied, the rule shall be disâ€”
charged, or made absolute, according as the court may deem the
answer sufficient or not. The movant of the rule, however,
may traverse the truth of such answer, in which case an issue
shall be made up and tried by a jury at the same term, unless
good cause of continuance be shown, which may be done once
only by either party. Upon the trial of such issue, the court
shall discharge the rule or make the same absolute, according as
the verdict of the jury may be for or against the officer.
