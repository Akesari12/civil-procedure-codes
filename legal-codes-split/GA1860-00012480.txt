L At the term of the court when the application is made
--or at the term next after said partitioners have made their reâ€”;
turn, any of the defendants or persons concerned, against whom1
or whose right or title a judgment is sought may file objections
to the right of the applicant and the writ of partition, or to the
return of the partitioners, and may, by way of defense, show any
good and probable matter in bar of the partition asked for, or
may show that the demandant has not title to so much as is allowed and awarded to him by the said partitioners, or to any
part of the land, whereupon an issue shall be made up and tried
by a special jury, as in appeal cases.
