Witness shall answer pertinent questions.

A witness shall answer questions legal and pertinent to the
matter in issue, though his answer may establish a claim
against himself; but he need not give an answer which will
have a tendency to subject him to punishment for a felony;
nor need [he] give an answer which will have a direct tendency to degrade his character, unless it be to the very fact
in issue, or to a fact from which the fact at issue would be
presumed. But a witness shall answer as to the fact of his

previous conviction for felony.
