Upon the trial of the case, as hereinbefore provided,
if the jury should be of opinion, from the evidence, that the pro-‘
ceeding is malicious and without probable cause, they may find
in favor of the defendant, against the plaintifff, such damages as
they‘may deem reasonable and just, under all the circumstances
of the case; and should they so find, one verdict shall be sufficient, and said defendant may enter judgment and have execu-‘
.tion thereon, as in other cases at law. ‘
