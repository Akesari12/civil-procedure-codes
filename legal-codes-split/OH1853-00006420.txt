The ministerial officer, whose duty it â€œis to take
security in any undertaking provided for by this code, shall
have the right to require the person offered as surety, to
make an affidavit of his qualifications, which affidavit may
be made before such officer. The taking of such an affidavit
shall not exempt the officer from any liability, to which he
might otherwise be subject, for taking insufficient security.
