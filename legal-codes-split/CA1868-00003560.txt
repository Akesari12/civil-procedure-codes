Witness duly subpoenaed exempt from arrest in a civil
action.

Every person who has been in good faith served with a
subpoena to attend as a witness before a Court, Judge, Commissioner, referee, or other person, in a case where the disobedience of the witness may be punished as a contempt,
shall be exonerated from arrest, in a civil action, while going
to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there, and
returning therefrom.

1. This section does not exempt him from obeying any ordinary process of

the Court, e. g.. to attend and answer concerning his property, under asup- p

plementary writ. Page v. Randall, 6 Cal. 32.
