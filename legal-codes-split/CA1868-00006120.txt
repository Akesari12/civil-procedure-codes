‘Intervention, determination upon.
The Court shall determine upon the intervention at the

same time that the action is decided; if the claim of the
party intervening is not sustained, he shall pay all costs

incurred by the intervention.

‘Amended 1854, 6 74, p. 102.

1. Where the merits of the case were not investigated in the lower Court:
by reason of an uncertainty as to the proper mode of proceeding under the
anomalous provisions of the Practice Act rela ' to interventions, the Snpreme Court awarded a new trial, although the ' ‘on of the Court below
upon the main question involved was approved, and the only error disclosed
might have been cured by a direction to modify the judgment. Speyer Y.
