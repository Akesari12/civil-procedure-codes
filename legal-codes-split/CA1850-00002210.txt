Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge may, if it
appear to him that there is danger of the debtorâ€™s absconding, issue a warrant under his hand, requiring
the Sheriff of any county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him before such judge.
Upon being brought before the judge, he may be examined on oath, and ordered to enter into an
undertaking with sufficient surety that he will attend, from time to time, before the judge or referee, as
he shall direct, during the pendency of the proceedings, and until the final determination thereof, and
will not in the meantime dispose of any portion of his property not exempt from execution. In default
of entering into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison by warrant under the hand of the
judge.
