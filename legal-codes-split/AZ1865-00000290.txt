Where the action is against .two or more defendants, and the
summons is served on one or more, but not on all of them, the plaintifff may
proceed as follows:

lst. If the action be against the defendants jointly indebted upon. a contract, hemay proceed against the defendant served, unless the court otherwise direct ; and if he recover judgment, it may be entered against all the
defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced
against the joint property of all, and the separate property of the defendant
served; or,

2d. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may proceed

against the defendants served, in the same manner as if they were the only
defendants.
