A motion in arrest of judgment differs from a motion
for a new trial in this : the former must be predicated on some
defect which appears on the face of the record or pleadings,
while the latter must be predicated on some extrinsic matter not
so appearing. It also differs from a motion to set aside a judgment in this: the motion, in arrest of judgment, must be made
during the term at which such judgment was obtained, While a
motion to set it aside may be made at any time Within the statute of limitations.
