Upon an appeal from a judgment or order, the appellate court
may reverse, ailirm, or modify the judgment or order appealed from, in the
respect mentioned in the notice of appeal, and as to any or all of the parties ; and may set aside or conhrm, or modify, any or all of the proceedings
subsequent to, or dependent upon such judgment or order; and may, if necessary or proper, order a new trial. When the judgment or order is reversed
or modified, the appellate court may make complete restitution of all property and rights lost by the erroneous judgment or order; and when it
appears to the appellate court that the appeal was made for delay, it may
add to the costs such damages as may be just.
