After an action for the recovery of money is brought,
the defendant may offer in court to confess judgment for part
of the amount claimed, or part of the causes involved in the
action. Whereupon, if the plaintifff, being present, refuse
to accept such confession of judgment in full of his demands
against the defendant in the action, or having had such notice that the offer would be made, of its amount, and of the
time of making it, as the court shall deem reasonable, fail
to attend, and, on the trial, do not recover more than was
so offered to be confessed, such plaintifff shall pay all the
costs of the defendant incurred after the offer. The offer
shall not be deemed to be an admission of the cause of action or amount to which the plaintifff is entitled, nor be given
in evidence upon the trial.
