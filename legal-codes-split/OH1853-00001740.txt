The return of “ not found,” upon an execution
against the body of the defendant, shall be necessary to fix
the liability of the sheriff as bail, which liability shall be the
amount of the judgment, interest and costs. This liability
can be enforced only in a separate action against him, or
against him and his sureties on his oiiicial bond, as in other
cases of delinquency.
