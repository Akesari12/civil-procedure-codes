—Jndgmcnt and execution.

The statement may be filed with the clerk of the Superior
Court of the county in which the defendant resides, or if
he does not reside in the State, of some county in which he
has property. The clerk shall endorse upon it, and enter
on his judgment docket, a judgment of the court, for the
amount confessed, with three dollars costs, togetherwith
disbursements. The statement and affidavit, with the judgment endorsed, shall thencefOrth become the judgment-roll.
Executions may be issued and enforced thereon, in the same
manner as upon judgments in other cases in such courts.
When the debt for which the judgment is recovered, is not

all due, or is payable in installments, and the installments:
are not all due, the execution may issue upon such judgment for the collection of such installments as have become v
due, and shall be in the usual form, but shall have endorsed
thereon, by the attorney or person issuing the same, a direction to the sheriff to collect the amount due on such judg~
ment, with interest and costs, which amount shall be stated,
with interest thereon, and the costs of said judgment. Not—
withstanding the issue and collection of such execution,
the judgment shall remain as security for the installments
thereafter to become due; and whenever any further installments become due execution may, in like manner, he issued
for the collection and enforcement of the same.
