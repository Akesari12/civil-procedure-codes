Any judgment, or verdict, rule or order of court,3
which may have been obtained, or entered up, shall be set aside,j
and be of no effect if it shall appear that the same was entered
up in consequence of corrupt and willful perjury; and it shall
be the duty of the court, in which such verdict, judgment, rule
or order, was obtained or entered up, to cause the same to be set
aside, upon motion and notice to the adverse party ; but it shall
not be lawful for the said court to do so, unless the person
charged with such perjury shall have been thereof duly convicted,
and unless it shall appear to the said court, that the said verdict,
judgment, rule or order, could not have been obtained and entered up, without the evidence of such perjured person, saving
always to third persons, innocent of such perjury, the right
which they may lawfully have acquired under such verdict, judgment, rule or order, before the same shall have been actually vacated and set aside. .
