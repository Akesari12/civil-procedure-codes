The following oath shall be administered to the jurors,
viz: “ You shall well and truly inquire whether A. B. has made
any forcible entry into the lands or tenements of C. D., and him
ejected therefrom, or forcibly detained the lands or tenements of
the said C. D., and a true verdict give according to the facts as
they may appear to you in evidence. So help you God.”
