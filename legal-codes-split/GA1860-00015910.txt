A bill is either original 'or in the nature of original.
Every bill is original which commences a proceeding for relief or
discovery, or both. Bills for the review, or avoidance, or injunction, or execution of a former decree are in the nature of original
bills. A 'cross bill need not be filed in this State. The defendant in every case may set up any matter in his answer, which under the English practice should be the subject of a cross bill, and
may require therein any discovery from the complaint he may
desire. No supplemental bill need be filed in this State. All
such matter shall be allowed by way of amendment. If new parties are necessary, by reason of any matter thus set up ‘in the answer or by way .of amendment, the court shall give such direction to the cause, to secure a bearing to such parties, as if a cross
bill or supplemental bill had been filed. Bills of revivor are
abolished. ’
