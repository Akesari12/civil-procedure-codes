When the levy ismade in a different county from
that in which the judgment is rendered, if a claim is interposed to the property, it is the duty of the sheriff to return
the original execution to the office of the clerk from which
it issued, with his return thereon of the interposition of a
claim; and make true copies of the bond and affidavit, which
he must return with the execution. He must also make a
true copy of the execution, and the returns thereon, which,
with the affidavit and bond, he must return to the oiiice of
the clerk of his own county, where the trial of the right of
property is to be had. The copies thus required to be made,
certifie by the sheriff to be true copies of the original, must
be received in lieu of, and have the same effect in all respects
as the originals.
