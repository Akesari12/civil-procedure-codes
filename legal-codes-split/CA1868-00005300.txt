Demurrer to pleadings in Justices’ Courts.

Either party may object to a pleading of his adversary, or
to any ‘part thereof, that it is not sufficiently explicit to enable him to understand it, or that it contains no cause of
action or defense, although it be taken as true. If the Court
deem the objection well founded, it shall order the pleading
to be amended, and if the party refuse to amend, the defective pleading shall he disregarded.

1. It isnot the policy of the law to coniine parties to any nice strictness in
pleading, particularly before Justices of the Peace. Accordingly, where a
party, instead of demurring for informality, goes to trial. it must be considered as cured by the verdict. Oroniec v. Oarghill, 4 Cal. 120.
