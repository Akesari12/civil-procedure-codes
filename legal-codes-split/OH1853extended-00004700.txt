If any judgment or judgments, in satisfaction of
which any lands or tenements, are sold, shall at any time
thereafter be reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or affect
the title of the purchaser or purchasers ; but in such case,
restitution shall be made by the judgment creditor of the
monies, for which such lands or tenements were sold, with
lawful interest from the day of sale.
