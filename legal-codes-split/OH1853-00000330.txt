Where a married woman is a party, her husband
' must be joined with her ; except,'when the action concerns
her separate property, she may sue without her husband, by
her next friend.

When the action is between herself and her husband, she
may sue or be sued alone; but in every such action other
than for a divorc r alimony, she shall prosecute and defend
by her next frien .
