A pure plea sets up some additional fact or facts,
which, taken with the facts stated in the bill, show that the complainant is not entitled to relief. An impure or anomalous -plea
is filed when the complainant, anticipating the defendant’s plea,
alleges facts to impeach or annul its effect. In such case the
plea must negative the impeaching allegations, and must be accompanied by an answer discovering all the facts within defen7
dant’s power as to such allegations. A pure plea need not be
verified. The answer accompanying an anomalous plea must be
under oath or afiirmation.
