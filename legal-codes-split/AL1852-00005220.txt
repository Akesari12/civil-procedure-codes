Judgment creditors, their agents or attorneys,
may obtain process of garnishment, against any person supposed to be indebted to the defendant, in any cause, where
execution could issue on the judgment, by making affidavit,
before the clerk of the court in which the jud ment was
rendered, that such erson is su posed to be inde ted to, or
have effects of the efendant in ' possession or under his
control, and that he believes process of garnishment against
such persons is necessary to obtain satisfaction of such judgment, and thereupon the clerk must issue the process, returnable forthwith if in term time, or to the next term of
the court, if in vacation; aud such proceedings shall thereon
be had as u n arnishments in original attachments.
