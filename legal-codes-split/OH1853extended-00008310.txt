If on the trial the justice shall be satisfied from
the probf that the property, or any part thereof, belongs to
the claimant or claimants, such justice shall render judgment

against the party in whose favor such execution or attachment issued for the costs, and issue execution therefore, and

shall, moreover, give a written order to the constable who
levied on, or who may be charged with the duty of selling
such property, directing him to restore the same, or so much
thereof as may have been found to belong to such claimant
or claimants.
