own motion, except when the investigation will require the decision of difficult questions of law, direct a

reference in the following cases :

side, in which case the referees may be directed to hear and decide the whole issue, or to report upon

any specific question of fact involved therein ; or,
2. Where the taking of an account shall be necessary for the information 0f the court before

judgment, or for carrying a judgment or order into etl'ect ; or,

3. Where a question of fact, other than upon the pleadings, shall arise upon motion, or otherwise,
in any stage of the action. ยง 165. The report of the referees upon the whole issue shall stand as the decision of the Court, and
judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court, and
their decision may be excepted to, and reviewed in like manner, or a rehearing may be granted by the
Court in which the judgment is entered.
