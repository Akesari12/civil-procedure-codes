And if on appeal from the judgment of a justice
rendered on any such award, the court of common pleas shall
be satisfied that the award was obtained by fraud, corruption, or other undue means, such court shall set aside the
award, and proceed to hear and determine the cause on the
merits, as in other cases of appeal.
