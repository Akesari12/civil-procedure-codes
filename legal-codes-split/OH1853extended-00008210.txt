Upon the verdict being delivered to the justice, and
before judgment being rendered thereon, each juror shall be
entitled to receive fifty cents at the hands of the successful
party, which shall be taxed in the costs against his adversary. When the jury shall be unable to agree upon a verdict, the same compensation shall be paid them by the party
calling the jury, and the same shall be taxed in the cost bill
against the losing party.
