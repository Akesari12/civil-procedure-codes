Whenever an interlocutory decree is made dissolving an injunction to stay proceedings on a judgment at
law, the chancellor must require of the defendant a refunding bond, in double the amount of the sum enjoined, payable to and to be approved by the register, conditioned to refund the money and interest he may collect on the judgment,
if the same is on the final hearing of the bill perpetually enjoined; and the court may render a final decree on such bond
against any or all the parties thereto.
