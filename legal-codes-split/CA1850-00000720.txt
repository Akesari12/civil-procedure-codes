After demurrer either party may amend any pleading demurred to of course and without
costs, filing the same amended, and giving notice thereof within five days to the adverse party, who
shall have tive days to answer or demur thereto, if the pleading be a complaint, or three days to demur
thereto if it be an answer; but a party shall not so amend more than once. When a demurrer to a
complaint is overruled, and there is no answer filed, the Court may, upon such terms as shall be just,
allow the defendant to file an answer. If a demurrer to the answer be overruled, the facts
alleged in the answer shall still be considered as denied. A demurrer only admits the facts for the
sake of an argument.
