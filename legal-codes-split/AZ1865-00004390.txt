If no answer be made, the case shall be heard on the papers of
the applicant. If an answer be made which does not raise a question such
as is mentioned in section 474, but only such matters as may be explained
or avoided by a reply, the court may, in its discretion, grant time for replying. If the answer, or answer and reply, raise only questions of law, or put
in issue immaterial statements, not affecting the substantial rights of the

parties, the court shall proceed to hear, or fix a day for hearing, the argument of the case.
