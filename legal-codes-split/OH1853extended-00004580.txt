If, upon such return as aforesaid, it appear by the
inquisition, that two-thirds of the appraised value of said
lands and tenements so levied upon is sufficient to satisfy
the execution, with costs, the judgment on which such execution issued, shall not operate, as a lien, on the residue of the
debtor’s estate, to the prejudice of any other judgment creditor. But no tract of land shall be sold for less than two—
thirds of the value returned in the inquest; and nothing in
this section contained, shall in any wise extend to affect
the sale of lands by the State, but all lands therein, the property of individuals, indebted to the State for any debt or
taxes, or in any other manner, except for loans heretofore
authorized by the legislature, shall be sold without valuation, for the discharge of such debt, or taxes, agreeably to
the laws for such case made and provided.
