If it be alleged in the complaint and be established by evidence, or if it appear by the evidence without such allegation in the complaint, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property, or any part of it,
is so situated that partition cannot be made without great prejudice to
the owners, the court may order a sale thereof. Otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, it shall order a partition according to the respective
rights of the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint three referees
therefore; and shall design ate the portion to remain undivided for the owners
whose interests remain unknown or are not ascertained.
