When a judgment shall be rendered for a conveyance, release, or acquittance, in any court of this State, and
the party against whom the judgment shall be rendered, does
not comply therewith by the time appointed, such judgment
shall have the same operation and effect, and be as available, as if the conveyance, release, or acquittance had been
executed conformany to such judgment. This section shall
apply to decrees rendered or to be rendered in suits now

pending.
