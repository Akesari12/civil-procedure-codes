xiv SECOND REPORT OF THE
Second Report of the Code Commissioners.
On-'xcn or ComussIormns dI-' Cons,
Raleigh, August 31st, 1868.
To the General Assembly qf the Sfate Q/` North Carolina .-
The Commissioners appointed by the Constitutional Con-
vention, to prepare among other things, a Code of Practice
and Procedure in civil actions for the courts of this State,
respectfully present the concluding portion of that Code
with the exception of certain detailed regulations for what
are called " Special Proceedings, " including:
1. Application for year's provision of a widow.
2. The laying off of dower.
3. Partition of real and personal property.
4. Foreclosure of mortgage.
5. Habeas Corpus.
6. Mandamus.
7. Laying off property exempt from execution.
8. Ejectment tbr the recovery of real estate.
9. Proceedings in contempt.
10. Proceedings on impeachment.
As they understand the law of New York, these proceed-
ings are only generally, and not fully, provided for in its
Code of Procedure, but are regulated at least in part, by cer-
tain statutes contained in the second volume of their Revised
Statutes.
Proceedings in these cases, are accordingly left by your
Commissioners for the present, to be governed by the exist-
ing Statutes, as tar as may be consistently with the provis-
ions of the Code of Civil Procedure
The Commissioners ask leave to submit a few observations
respecting the circumstances under which their work has
been performed, and the manner of its performance.

CODE COMMISSIONERS. XV
The Constitution required ,that 1l.ey blmuld present such
a Code £o the Legislature at its present session; it contem-
plated the abolition, as soon as such u Code could be pre-
pared, of all existing forms of actions, and of all distinctions
between actions at law and suits in Equity; Courts ol Equity
were immediately abolished by the Constitution. The Com-
missioners felt the necessity of diligence and even of a
degree of haste incompatible with the perfection which
mightreasonably be expected from a longer time for consid-
eration and review. They commenced their labors as soon
as they had any assurance that the Constitution would
become the law of the State, and in two months have pre-
pared and presented to your body:
1. An Analysis of the entire Code of the State.
2. A bill for the government oi counties.
3. A bill defining the powers and duties of Clérk's of the
Superior Courts as Judges of Probate.
4. A bill concerning the Jurisdiction of Justices of the
Peace.
5. A Code of Civil Procedure for the Superior Courts.
Besides many others on subjects of great importance,
requiring both research and reflection, but upon which
members of your body thought early legislation necessary
for the public good. Some idea may be formed of the dili-
gence with which the Commissioners have. labored, when it
is considered that nearly five years elapsed between the
appointment of the Commissioners to prepare the Revised
Code, and its publication. In reference to the Code of
Practice, so great has been their sense of the necessity for
promptly providing rules ibr thejguidance of the newly
created Courts, that they have ventured to present it to you
in piece meal, without reserving to themselves any oppor-
tunity for reviewing it as a whole.
Under such circumstances, it is inevitable that imperfec
tions will be found,Which such a review would have readily
disclosed. We feel authorized, therefore, to ask a generous .
criticism of our laborsfrom you, as well as from the profes-
sion, which because it is.best'able to gappreciate the diiiicul-
Diginzed by C008 le
'xvi SECOND REPORT OF THE
ties of the task, is always disposed to regard in a kindly
spirit, every effort directed in good fhith to improve the
administration ofjustice.
As the Constitution adopted the language of the law of
New York in its provisions for abolishing the distinction in
the forms of actions; and as the Code of that State was the
iirst adopted, and has been the model on which those of
many other States have been since framed, the Commis-
sioners did not hesitate to take the Code of New York as
*the basis of that to be prepared for this State, with such
modifications as the differing circumstances of the two States
might make expedientl
In general, they have endeavored to make such changes
only as were absolutely commanded or clearly implied in
the words oi the Constitution, or as were manifestly proper.
To point out the changes in detail, would occupy too much
of your time.
The Code we present, forms as nearly as was possible
under the circumstances in which it has been prepared, a
consistent whole; there is scarce any part which can be
altered without involving alteration in some or numerous
others. We therefore invite your honorable body to pass i-t
as it is, and leave to experience, to expose the places which
require amendment. The Code of New York was adopted
.in 1848 as it come from the hands of the Commissioners,
and has ever since been undergoing amendments, suggested
by experience, and so framed by the most able lawyers, as
to lit in and harmonize with the other parts.
All can understand the value to a people, of a Code of
laws, embodying and regulating according to justice and
reason, the rights and duties of men in all the varying rela-
tions oflife and business; but none but those whose profes-
sion makes them necessarily familliar with the modes of
applying Qzose principles to actual transactions, can appre-
ciate that the machinery for such application is as essential
to justice as is the recognition of its principles.
In every Code for the administration of law, much is fixed
by the laws of the human mind, and is, therefore, essentially
Diginzed by C008 le
CODE COMMISSIONERS. xvii
alike in the practices of all countries; while much also is
purely arbitrary, and depends for its wisdom, on the habits
and condition of the people to whom it is applied.
For example: every man who has a complaint against his
neighbor, for which he seeks redress, must first summon the
supposed wrong-doer before some Judge, and must inform
him of the grounds of the complaint, and the defendant must
have an opportunity to answer.
These things are fixed in justice, and are to be found in
the practice of all countries. But what shall be the nature
of the summons,-whether or not the defendant shall be
arrested and held to bail, the time of notice, the manner of
service, and a vast number of other details which it is indis-
pensable lbr the convenience of all parties shall be prescribed
by some fixed and certain law, are purely arbitrary, and are
scarcely ever the same in any two States. It is not so
important what they are, as that they should be fixed and
clear and known, and conformable to the business usages of
a people, their grade of culture and facilities for mutual
intercourse.
WVe make these general observations to show the views
which have guided us in the preparation of this Code, con-
fident, that whatever may be the skill with which we have
applied them, the views themselves will be received by all,
as true. .
Detailed regulations for what are called " Special Proceed-
ings" are not urgent, they being sufficiently provided for, at
present, by the Code, and by the existing laws; we do not
propose, therefore, to present those at this, session of the
Legislature. -Very respectfully,

been filed. The clerk shall thereupon enter judgment for
the amount mentioned in the summons, against the defen-
dant or defendants, or against one or more of several defeni
dants, in the cases provided for in section eighty-seven. But
if the complaint be not sworn to, and such action . is on an
instrument for the payment of money only, the clerk, on its
productionto him, shall assess the amount dhe to the plaintiff
thereon; and in other cases shall ascertain the amount which
the plaintiff' is entitled to recover in such action, from his
examination, under oath, or other proof, and enter the judg-
ment for the amount so assessedor ascertained In case the
defendant give notice of .appearance in the action, he shall
be»entitled to tive days' notice of the time and place of such
assessment.
Where the defendant, by his answer in such action, shall
not deny the plaintiffs claim, but shall set up a counter-
claim, amounting to less than the plaintiffs claim, judgment
may be had by the plaintiff for the excess of said claim over
the said counter-claim, in like manner in any such action,
upon the plaintiffs filing with the clerk of the Court a state-
ment admitting such counter claim, which statement shall
be annexed to and be a part of the judgment-roll.
2. In other actions the plaintilf may, upon the like proof,
apply to the Court, after the expiration of the time for
answering, for the relief demanded in the complaint. If the
taking of an account or the proof of any fact be necessary
to enable the Court to give judgment, or to carry the judg-
ment into effect, the Court may take the account or hear the
proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that
Diginzed by C008 le

purpose. And Where the action is tor the recovery of money
only, or of specific real or personal property, with damages
for the withholding thereof, the court may order the damages
to be assessed by a jury, or, if the examination of a long
account be involved, by a reference as above provided. If
the defendant give notice of appearance in the action before
the expiration of the time for answering, he shall be entitled
to eight days' notice of the time and place of application to
the Court for the relief demanded by the complaint.
3. In actions where the service of the summons was by
publication, the plaintiff may, in like manner, apply for
judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be
made of the demand mentioned in the complaint; and if the
defendant be not a resident ci' the State must require the
plaintiff or his agent to be examined on oath respecting any
payments that have been made to the plaintiff, or to any one
for his use, on account of such demand, and may render
judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover.

requirethe plaintiff to cause to be *filed satisfactory security,
to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution' of
any estate or effects which may be directed by such judgment
to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money
that may be collected under or by virtue of such judgment,
in case the defendant or his representatives shall apply and
be admitted to defend the action, and shall succeed in such
defence.

as referee in any action pending in the court of which he is
Judge or Justice, and not already referred, unless the

make and deliver a report within sixty days from the time
the action shall be Hnally submitted; and in default thereof,
and before the report is delivered, either party may serve

such case be entitled to any tees.
The report of the referee shall be made to the clerk of the
court in which the action is pending: either party after ten
days notice to the adverse party, may move the Judge to
review such report, and set aside, modify, or confirm the
