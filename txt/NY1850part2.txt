by persons under disability, and the rights of persons in pos-
session require that they should be brought or abandoned. It
will be remembered, that the operation of this provision is

§ 604. An unmarried female may prosecute, asplain-
fig; an action for her own seduction, and may recover
therein such damages as shall be assessed in her fa-
The purpose of this section and the next is to wipe away
from our law a reproach, to which it has long been subject,
that of giving no adequate remedy for one of the greatest
offences against society, which a man can commit, that of se-
duction. At present the law gives only an action to the
parent, or to one who stands in his relation, founded upon
the notion, that he has suH'ered a pecuniary injury by the
loss of service of the person seduced. Now the seduction of
awoman, by which is meant inducing her, by persuasion,
threats, or fraud, to consent to the sacrifice of her virtue, isan
injury to herself and to her relations, of the gravest charac-
ter. For this injury the law should provide a remedy, not
by means of a iiction, but open and direct, in favor of the
person injured.
The objection, that will be made to an action by the woman,
is that she has consented to the act. That however does not
seem to us an answer,for two reasons. First, there are many
other cases, where the law does now give an action for an
injury to a party consenting; as for example, in the case of
property obtained by false representation or other fraud,
money lost upon stocks, at play, or borrowed upon usury.
Secondly,the woman and her seducer do not stand upon
equal grounds; she is the weaker party, and the victim of
his arts.
With this short statement of our own views,and the follow-
ing passage from Paley, we submit these sections to the
judgment of the legislature.
"The seducer practices. the same stratagems to draw a
woman's person into his power, that a swindler does to get

with such facility does it accommodate itself to the pleasures
and conveniency of higher life.
Seduction is seldom accomplished without fraud; and. the
fraud is by so much more criminal than other frauds, as the
injury effected by it is greater, continues longer, and less ad-
mits reparation.
This injury is threefold; to the woman; to her family ;
and to the public.
1. The injury to the woman is made up of the pain she
sutfers from shame, or the loss she sustains in her reputation
and prospects of marriage, and of thc depravation of her
moral principle.
' This pain must be extreme, if we may judge of it from
those barbarous endeavors to conceal their disgrace, to which
women, under such circumstances, sometimes have recourse ;
comparing also their barbarity with their passionate fondness
for their oB`spring in other cases. Nothing but an agony of
mlnd the most insupportable can induce a woman to forget her
nature, and the pity which even a stranger would show to a
helpless and imploring infant. It is tme, that all are not
urged to this extremity ; but if any are, it aifords an indica-
tion of how much all suH`er from the same cause. What shall
we say to the authors of such mischief 'Q
* The loss which a woman sustains by the ruin of her
reputation,almost exceeds computation. Every person's hap-
piness depends in part upon the respect and reception which
they meet with in the world ; and it is no inconsiderable mor-
titication, even to the firmest temper, to be rejected from the
society of their equals, or received by them with neglect and
disdain. But this is not all, nor the worst. By a nile of
life, which it is not easy to blame, and which it is impossible
to alter, a woman loses with her chastity the chance of mar-
rying at all, or in any manner equal to the hopes she had been
accustomed to entertain. Now marriage, whatever it be to
a man, is that from which every woman expects her chief '
happiness. And thisis still more true in low life, of which
condition the women are, who are most exposed to solicitations
of this sort. Add to this, that when a woman's maintenance
depends upon her character, (as it does in a great measure,
with those who are to support themselves by service,) little
Digitized by GOO8 le
crvu. nocmnvu. 24?
sometimes is left to the forsaken sufferer, but to starve for
want of emplt>yment, or to have recourse to prostitution for
food and miment.
3. As a woman collects her virtue into this point, the loss
of her chastity is generally the destruction of her moral prin-
ciples; and this consequence is to be apprehended, whether
the criminal intercourse be discontinued or not.
II. The injury to the family may be understood, by the
application of that infallible rule, " of doing fo others, what
we would that others should do unto us." Let a father or
brother say, for what consideration they would suffer this in-
jury to a daughter or sister ; and whether any, even a total
loss of fortune, could create equal atlliction or distress. And
when they reflect upon this, let them distinguish, if they can,
between a robbery, committed upon their property by fraud
or forgery, and the ruin of their happiness by the treachery of
a seducer.
III. The public at large lose the benefit of the woman's
service in her proper place and destination, as a wife and
parent. This to the whole community may be little ; but it
is otten more than all the good,which the seducer does to the
community, can recompense. Moreover prostitution is sup-
plied by seduction; and in proportion to the danger there is
of the woman betaking herself, after her first sacrihce, to a
life of public lewdness, the seducer is answerable for the
multiplied evils to which his crime gives birth.
Upon the whole, if we pursue the eH`ects of seduction
through the complicated misery which it occasions, and if it
be right to estimate crimes by thc mischief they knowingly
produce, it will appear something more than mere invective
to assert, that not one half of the crimes, for which men suH`er
death, by the laws of England, are so flagitious as this.
Yet the law has provided no punishment for this offence,
beyond a pecuniary satisfaction to the injured family ; and
this can only be come at, by one of the quaintest fictions in
the world; by the father's bringing his action against the se
ducer, for the loss of his daughter's service, during her preg-
nancy and nurturing." Paley's Moral Philosophy, p. 199.

And when, in an action for the recovery of real or per-
sonal property. a person, not a party to the action, but
having an interest in the subject thereof, makes appli-
cation to the court to be made a party, it may order
him to be brought in by the proper amendment.

property, may, at any time before answer, upon adi-
davit, that a person, not a party to the action, and with-
out collusion with him, makes against him a demand
for the same debt or property, apply to the court for an
order to substitute such person in his place, and dis-
charge him from liability to either party, on his deposit-
ing in court the amount of the debt, or delivering the
property or its value to such person as the court may
direct. And the court, after notice to the plaintiff and
such person, may, in its discretion, make the order;

and thereupon the substituted defendant shall stand in
the place of the original defendant, and the latter be
discharged from liability to either party.
The object of this section is to save the necessity, in most
cases, of an action to compel two parties, claiming the same
thing, to settle the controversy between them by interplead-
ing. The interpleader act in England was passed for the same
purpose.

bind the joint property of all the associates in the same
manner as if all had been named defendants, and had
been sued upon their joint liability. Any one of the
associates may also be sued for the obligation of all.

§ 622. The summons must be subscribed by the
plaintifi, or his attorney, and directed to the defendant,
requiring him to answer the complaint, and serve a
copy of his answer on the person whose name is sub-
scribed to the summons, at a place within the state,
therein specified, in which there is a post oilice, within
twenty days after the service of the summons, exclu-
sive of the day of service.
./Imended ow, 4 128.

a notice, in substance as follows:
1. In an action, arising on obligation for the recov-

sum specified therein, if the defendant fail to answer
the complaint:
2. In other actions, that if the defendant fail to an-
swer the complaint, the plaintiff will apply to the court
for the relief demanded therein.
./Imended Code, § 129.
§ 624. A copy of the complaint must be served with
the summons, unless the complaint itself be already on
the files of the court. In the latter case, the service of'
a copy with the summons may be omitted, but then the
summons must state where the complaint is Hled; and
if the defendant, within ten days thereafter, in person
or by attorney, demand in writing, a copy of the com-
plaint, specifying a place within the state where it may .
be served, a copy thereof must be served accordingly,
and after such service the defendant has twenty days to
answer ; but only one copy need be served on the same
attorney.
.fimended Code, § 130.
It will be seen, that this section differs from the code as
amended in this important respect, that while the latter per-
mits a plaintii to commence an action without filing or ser-
ving his complaint, the former requires it to be either filed or
served.
The reason for the change is this. If a defendant be
served with a summons, requiring him merely to answer a
complaint, which will be filed, he must, almost as a matter of
necessity, employ a lawyer, to see that no advantage is taken
of him. But if the summons inform the defendant that the
complaint against him is on Ble, and where he may find it,
Digitized by GOO8 le
256 THE com: OF
or, what is better, if it be accompanied by a copy, he can de-
termine for himself in most cases, whether there be any occasion
for him to make a defence. If it be desirable to relieve defend-
ants, as far aa possible, from the necessity of employing a
lawyer, then the section, as we have it, ought to stand.
If it be objected, that there are cases of great urgency, not
admitting of the delay incident to the preparation of a com-
plaint, it is to be answered, that such cases are very rare,
that an arrest or other provisional remedy cannot in any case
be had, without an affidavit, which requires as much time as
a complaint, and that formerly no serious embarrassment re-
sulted from requiring a bill to be filed before an injunction
was issued.
§ 625. In the case of a defendant against whom no
personal claim is made, the plaintiff may deliver to him
with the summons, a notice subscribed by the plaintiff
or his attorney, setting forth the general object of the
action, a brief description of the property, affected by
it, if it effect specific real or personal property, and that
no personal claim is made against such defendant, flf a
defendant, on whom such notice is served, unreasona-
bly defend the action he must pay costs to the plaintiff.
.Hmended Code,§ 130. Changed, so aa to embrace every
action instead of confining it, as before, to actions for partition
of real property or foreclosure of mortgages.
§ 626. In an action affecting the title to real property,
the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, or at
any time afterwards, may file with the clerk of each
county' in which the property is situated, a notice of the
pendency of such action, containing the names of the
parties, the object of the action, and a description of
the property in that county affected thereby, If the

action be for the foreclosure of a mortgage, such rr6>
tice must be filed twenty days before jndgmem, amd
must contain the date of the mortgage, the names of the
parties thereto, and the time and place of recording the
same. From the time of filing, and for two years 'there-
after only, the pendency of the action is constructive
notice to a purchaser or incumbrancer of the property
affected thereby, but the notice may be rehled from
time to time with the same elfect.

§ 627. The summons may be served by the sherid' of
the county where the defendant is found, or by any
other person, not a pany to the action, The service
must be made, and the summons returned, with proof
of the service, to the person whose name is subscribed

In the Code, as originally reported, a demurrer was only
allowed to a complai »t. Demurrers to answers and replies
are allowed by an amendment made at the last session. The
Commissioners adhere to their former system, and recommend
that there should not be a demurrer to an answer or reply.
The question is important as a question of time. Demurrers
are considerable hindrances to the progress of a cause. Let
the defendant put in his. answer at his peril; the risk of
mischance is small. If he havea defence, it is scarcely pos-,
sible he should lose it. But.if demurrers be allowed,they
will become fruitful sources of expense and delay. A demur-
rer to an answer was not allowed in chancery, and no ham
ever came from its exclusion. Il the restoration we propose
be not made, not only will demurrers often be interposed to
answers, as a means of harrassing defendants and subjecting
them to wxpense, but demurrers to replies will be resorted to
by defendants who desire delay.

§ 846. The counterclaim mentioned in the last sec-
tion, must be one existing in favor of a defendant, and
against plaintiff, between whom a several judgment
might be had in the action, and arising out of one of
the following causes of action:
1. A cause of action, arising out of the contract or
transaction set forth in the complaint, as the founda-
tion of the plaintifl"s claim, or connected with the sub-
ject of the action:
2. In an action arising on obligation, any other cause
of action arising also on obligation, and existing at the
commencement of the action.
In what cases a cross-demand should be litigated in the
same action with the original claim, is a question of some im-
portance. On one :ide it is said, that there is great incon-
venience in having several distinct controversies thrown to-
gether into one trial ; while on the other it is answered, that
there is a greater inconvenience in having several law-suits,
where one would answer the purpose.
The statute of set-off was the first innovation upon the com-
mon law. That, however, was quite limited in its operation.
Of late years, the courts have let in a new set of cross-demands,
under the name of recoupement. We propose in this section
to open the door still wider, and to admit many cross-demands,
now excluded. Further experience may show, that the door
should be opened wider still.
The first subdivision of this section is intended to remove
a doubt which has been sometimes expressed, whether affir-
mative relief' can be given, upon an answer setting up a de~
fence which heretofore would have been accounted equitable
only. For example, in the case of an action to dispossess an
occupant of land; the defendant claims to occupy under a
contract to purchase, and asks on his part for a judgment
that the plaintiff give him a conveyance. It is the intention
of the code, that the whole controversy between the partia
Digitized by GOO8 le
268 nm mpg or
should be settled in one action, amd that either plaintiff or de
fendant should have such relief, as the nature of the case re-
quircs. It is as easy to do this, as it is to decide upon what
was considered a mere equitable defence to a legal demand,
and there is no difficulty in either.
Suppose an action upon a written agreement to recover
damages for not performing it. The defendant answers that'
the writing does not express the intention of the parties, and
that he did perform it according to the real agreement be'
tween them. Is such a defence admissible under the code?
That question involves another, which is this ; is the ag'ree~
ment by the law of the land binding upon the defendant as-it'
stands, or is it not 'I
Now ifit be not binding upon him, that is, if before the
code he could by any form of action get rid of it, he can do'
so now in the action prosecuted under the code. The etfect
of the code is to open the door to remedies without disturb-
ing rights. It has not changed the rights of the parties. It
has simplified and shortened their remedies.
It should be borne in mind that the rulcs of courts of equity
are already in numbcrless instances administered by courts of
law, even in those states where courts of equity exist, and uni-
uersally in those states where there are no courts of equity,
so lar as the strict forms of common law courts will allow.
Take the case of Pennsylvania. The common law courts
have from time immemorial administered equity law. The
only embarrassment that has attended it, has arisen from the
imperfect machinery of the courts of law. lf they had en-
larged their forms, as our code has enlarged them, their sys-
tem would have been excellent. Their courts of' law have al-
ways held that the defendant may set up an equitable defence ¢
In the case of Jordan & Cooper 3, S. & R. 578, Chief Justice
Tighlman said, "That equity is a pant of the law of Penn-
sylvania, has never been disputed, and that a defendant
may put in a plea founded upon equityonly, is equally clear."
A jurist nf Pennsylvania, in an edition of an English work
on Equity, uses the following remarkable language:
" The rules of equity being consolidated with those of law,
it is evident that our only deficiency is in the special mac/Linuy
of chaucery, where that machinery is better adapted than the
Digitized by GOO8 le
cxvu. rnocrmnuz. 269
forms of law to the due attainment of justice. Whether it is
not more consistent with judicial perfection, that then shouid
be a single rule of action for every subject matter, serving all
courts alike, and whether the butter mode of improving the
jurisprudence of the state, would not be to foster the growth
of a mixed system, that may in time combine the advantages
of law and equity with amendments of their known imperfec-
tions, are great problems that have occupied the most diath-
guished jurists of all ages, and are not likely soon to receive
an acknowledged solution." (1 Fonblanque's Equity, 4th
Am. edition, p. 20.)
Indeed it may now be considered an inevitable tendency of
the times, to obliterate the distinction between legal and equi-
table forms, and to administer law and equity, in one tri-
bunal and one action. Even in England, the country where
the resistance to innovation is strongest, there appear to be
indications of a movement in that direction. In a late num-
ber of the Law Magazine, a journal of authority in that coun-
try, there is an article on English and Scottish judicature, in
which the following language is used--"The system," that
is, the administration of law and equity separately, "is not
one, that can, in any absolute and conclusive sense, try, hear,
and determine the merits of any cause. It does not begin at
the beginning and go on to the end. It moves here and it
moves there, with ever and anon some by-battle on extrinsic
questions, by such etlifying enlightners of the merils qf a
cause (!) as demurrers on the ground of duplicity, demurrers
for want of equity, clemurrers to the jurisdiction and the like,
for which of course the litigants have to pay-but it does not
bv its direct and immediate operation ascertain the truth of
the controversy. It does not profess to do so. The several
courts minister to but do not administerjustice. They may
exhaust all their judicial powers, but something will be left
behind. The law courts will not deal with 'the equities,'
the courts of equity will not interfere where law has jurisdic-
tion, and thus the suitor is tossed about from court to court-
it is a sort of battledore and shuttlecock litigation-and the
unfortunate litigant has to incur the costs of both courts, and
Mt, be it observed, for one single remedy, demandable with
reference to one particular state of facts !"

§ 651. When the answer contains new matter con-
stituting a counter-claim, the plaintiff may within
twenty days, reply to such new matter, denying each
allegation eontroverted by him, or any knowledge or
information thereof suiiicient to form a belief; and he
may allege, in ordinary and concise language, without
repetition, and in such a manner as to enable a person
of common understanding to know what is intended,
any new matter, not inconsistent with the complaint,
constituting a defence to the counter-claim.
.dmmded Code, § 153.
In respect to the reply, we propose this modification ; that
it shall only be required, when the answer sets up a counter-
claim. VVhen the answer is drawn by a very wary or a very
unskilful hand, the sentences become sometimes so involved,
and the admissions or denials so clogged with qualifications,
that it is not easy to separate the new matter from that which
is strictly responsive to the complaint. If the pleader would
confine himself to facts pertinent to the case, and would state
these in distinct allegations separately numbered, there would
be no difliculty, When this is not done, and the answer is
loosely dmwn, the reply under the existing rule may occasion
some embarrassment. To obviate this, we propose, that the
reply be confined to the case of a counter-claim; in which
case it seems indispensable, for the cross demand is of the
nature of a new action by the defendant against the plaintiff,
to which the latter ought to make answer.

reply, must be verified by the party, his agent or 'attor-
ney, to the elfect that he believes it to be true. The
verification must be made, by the aflidavit of the party,
or, if there be several parties united in interest and
pleading together, by one at least of such parties,
if such party be within the state and capable of making
the allidavit; otherwise the ailidavit may be made by
the agent or attorney of the party. The affidavit may
also be made by the agent or attorney, if the action or
defence be founded upon a written instrument for the
payment of money only, and such instrument be in the
possession of the agent or attorney, or if all the mate-
rial allegations of the pleading be within the personal
knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the adida-
Digitized by GOO8 le
crm. rnocl-tmiu.
vit is made by the agent or attorney, it must set forth
the reason of his making it.
The verification may be omitted, when an adxhission
of the truth of the complaint might subject the 'party
to prosecution for felony. And no pleading, verified as
herein required, can be used in a criminal prosecution
against the party, as proof of a fact admitted or elleged
in such pleading.
.dmendal Code,§ 157.
This section, it will be perceived, is changed from the form
which it bears, in the amended code, to that substantially
which the Commisdoners recommended in their second report.
The original code required the pleadings to be verified in all
cases, except when theparty would be privileged from testi-
fying as a witness to the same matters; the amended code
requires it only in those cases wherethe previous pleading
has been veritied. So that the plaintitf may in all cases veri-
fy his complaint or not, as he pleases; if, however, he do
verify it, then the answer must be verified, otherwise it need
not. Still the defendant may, if he choose, verify his
answer,and in that case the reply must be verified. The
diderence between the two schemes is this, that the one
does not permit a pany to malce an allegation, when he is
not willing to make oath of his belief in it ; the other per-
mits him to make what allegations he pleases, whether he
believes them or not. .
Ought these solemn allegations of the parties, which are
called pleadings, and which set forth the cause of action and
defence, to be verilied or not? The solution ot this ques-
'tion depends upon two others: first, whether a party should
he allowed to aver what he does not believe; and.second,
whether there he any better test of his belief, than his own
afiidavit. Both questions admit of easy answers.
There are several reasons whv a party should not be per-
mitted to aver, in a court of justice, what he does not believe:
Imvu. comm] 18
Digitized by GOO8 le
'rn oonl: or #14
First. The courts are, or should be, schools of moraTs. It
becomes them to set virtuous examples. Of all the institu-
tions of society, they should be most sacred to truth. When-
ever, therefore, they sanction, connive at,.or open the door to
untruths, they falsify their own professions, and becc me the
corrupters, rather than the teachers of mankind.
Second. Men should be protected, as far as possible,against
false charges. It is signally unjust, that any person should
vex another with a claim, founded upon statements which he
does not believe. Nay more, it is the highest duty of society,
to protect every member of it in the enjoyment of his rights.
What sort of pro'ection does it afford, if it allows these rights
to be asmiled by every adventurer, even though he furnishes,
not only no security against his misconduct, and no proofs of
his charge, but no test of his sincerity, not so much even as
his affidavit of belief in it.
Third. Lawsuits are a disadvantage to society at large-
They require a large array of public oflicers. They require
the attendance of citizens, either as jurors or as witnesses,
to the detriment of their own affairs. It seems consequently
most fit, that a check, at least as great as this, should be in-
terposed to the prosecution of frivolous or fictitious lawsuits.
fburth. If the party be not confined in his pleading to
what he believes, no adequate reform in pleading can ever be
etfected. Should the rule adopted by the last legislature be
retained, plaintiffs may put in the old t`orm'of declarations as
complaints under the code ; defendants then must answer every
allegation speciiically, or it will be taken as true. Will this
be tolerated any considerable length of time't It will not ;
and then either the oath will be required, or this rule of
pleading will be abrogated, and the general issue, as formerly
brought into use.
If then it be clear, that no party should be allowed to
aver in a coun of justice what he does not believe, the re-
maining inquiry is, whether there be any better test of one's~
belief than his afliclavit. Here there seems no room for
question. The oath is the universal test applied to the con-
sciences of witnesses. If it be good for the witnesses, it is
equally good for the litigants.
What reasonis there, that the aiidavit should not be re-
Digitized by GOO8 le
cxvn. PBOCILDURE. m
quired? The multiplication of oath, says one. Then abol-
ish oaths altogether. Let witnesses be no more sworn. But
so long as you administer the oath to the witness, require it
also of the party. Requiring it of him, so far from multiply-
ing oaths, diminishes them. For every oath required ofa party
more than two witnesses are dispensed with. Who that is
at all conversant with the courts, but knows, that every day
in court sees numerous witnesses brought, at great inconven-
ience to themselves, to swear to facts, which the parties
would not dare deny, if they were put to their oaths. Can
there be a doubt which is better, to harrass the witnesses, or to
purge the consciences of the parties 'l
§ 653. It is not necessary for`a party to set forth in a
pleading the items of an account therein alleged, where
they exceed twenty in number, but he must deliver to
the adverse party, within ten days, after a demand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account verified by his
own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect
that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giv-
ing evidence thereof The court, or a judge thereof;
or a county judge, may order a further account, when
the one delivered is defective.

284 THE conm or
./Imended Code, § 178. It has been sometimes doubted
whether this section abolishes the writ of ne exeat. Why it
should be doubted we cannot understand. The language ap-
pears to us as explicit as it can be made. Nothing certainly
was farther from onr intention than to leave any mode of ar-
rest not provided for in this chapter, except upon proceed-
ings for contempt, and under the act to abolish imprisonment
for debt. As it is now proposed to repeal the latter, this sec-
tion is intended to embrace every caseof arrest in a civil ac-
tion, except for contempt.
§ 675. The defendant may bearrested, as hereinafter
prescribed, in the following cases:
1. In an action for the recovery of damages, on a
cause of action arising on an obligation, where the de-
fendant is not a resident of the state, or is about to re~
move therefrom, or where the action. is for a wilful in-
jury to person, or to property knowing the property to
belong to another:
2. In an action for a fine, or penalty, or ona promise
to marry, or for money or property embezzled, or fraud-
ulently missapplied, or converted to hisown use, by a
public officer, or an oHicer of a corporation., or- an at-
torney, factor, broker, agent or clerk, in the course of
his employment as such, or by any other person in a
fiduciary capacity, or for misconduct or 'neglect in ofl
tice or in a professional employment:
3. In an action to recover the possession of personal
property unjustly detained, where the property or any
part thereof has been concealed, removed or disposed
UR so that it cannot be found or taken by the sheriifz

4. When the defendant has been guilty of a fiaud, in
contracting the debt, or incurring the obligation, for
which the action is brought, or in concealing or dispo-
sing of the property, 'for the taking, detention, or con-
version of which the action is brought:
5. \Vhen the defendant has removed, concealed or
disposed of, his property, or is about to do so, with in-
tent to defraud his creditors:
s. When the arrest of the defendant is expressly au-
thorized by special statutes, in an action for a fine or
penalty, or for a wilful violation of duty. But no female
can be arrested, in any action, except fora wilful injury
to person, character or property: »

section. It is to save the necessity of repeated notica of
trial. If a cause be not tried, as it ought to be, at the iirs
term, it must remain upon the calendar at subsequent terms,
until reached. A similar practice exists in many of the
states, where no incovenience results from it.

§ 774. When the jury has been completed and sworn,
the trial must proceed in the following order, unless the
court, for special reasons, otherwise directs:
1. The plaintilf aiier stating the issue, must open the
case and produce the evidence on his part:
2. The defendant may then open his defence and
offer his evidence in support thereof:
a. The parties may then respectively offer rebutting
evidence only, unless the court for good reason, in fur-
therance of justice, permit them to offer eddence upon
their original case:
4. When the evidence is concluded, unless the case
is submitted to the jury on either side, or on both sides,
without argument, the defendant must commence, and
the plaintid` conclude the argument to the jury:

5. If several defendants, having separate defences,
appear by different counsel, the court must determine
their relative order in the evidence and argument:
6. The court may then charge the jury.
The length to which trials are now protracted is a matter
of great and just complaint. The remedy lies chiedy MW
the courts. If they would adhere indexibly to the rule, that
a question once decided shall not be debated anew ; and would
stop the examination of a witness when he has been already
sudiciently examined, a vast deal of time might be saved.
It is a rule in the English courts, and in the courts of some of
our states, that a counsel shall stand while he is examining a
witness. The same rule would be useful here. As trials an
now sometimes conducted, the counsel sits leisurely in his
seat, writing down at length all the questions and answers,
and the court meeting at ten and adjouming at three, a single
witness remains under examination from day to day, and the
trial lasts for weeks, when it should be ended in as many
days.
By a provision in another place, we propose that counsel
shall be limited in their arguments to a fixed time. With
resolution on the part of the courts, and a few rules, such
as they should adopt, we are persuaded that more than half
the time now spent in trials might be saved.
§ 775. Vlfhenever, in the opinion of the court, it in
.proper that the jury should have a view of real pro-
petty which is the subject of the litigation, or of the
place in which any material fact occurred, it may order
the jury to be conducted in a body; in the custody of
proper oilicers, to the place, which will be shown to
them by the judge, or by a person appointed by the
court for that purpose While the jury are thus absent,
no person, other than the judge or person so appointed,

must speak to them on any subject ccsnnected with the
trial.
§ 776. The jurors may be kept together in charge df
proper oflicers, or may, in the discretion of the court,
at any time before the submission of the cause to the
§ury, be *permitted to separate. In either case, they
may be admonished by the court, that it is their duty
not to converse with any other person or among them-
halves, on any subject connected with the trial, or to
form or express any opinion thereon, until the cause is
'finally submitted to them.
§777. IC after the impaneling of the jury, and be-
fine verdict, a juror become sick, so as to be unable to
'iierforrn his duty, the court may order him to be dis-
charged. In that case a new juror may be sworn, and
the trial begin anew, or the jury may be discharged,
and a new jury then or afterwards impanelled.
§ 778. In charging the jhry, the court must state to
them all matters of law which it thinks necessary for
ihiéir iimformation 'in giving their verdict: and if it
i-ésent the facts of the case, it must also inform
jiiry that they are the exclusive judges' of all questiorls

§ 779. After hearing the charge, the jury may either

of one or more officers, until they agree upon their ver-
dict, or are discharged by the court. The oflicer must,
to the utmost of his ability, keep the jury thus togeth-
er, separate from other persons, without drink except
water, and without food, except ordered bythe court;
he must not suffer any communication to be made to
them, nor make any himself; unless by order of the
court, except to ask them if they have agreed upon
their verdict, and he must not, before the verdict is
rendered, communicate to any person the state of' their
deliberations or the verdict agreed on.

§ 782. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if
there be a disagreement between them as to any part
of the testimony, or if' they desire to be informed of
any point of law arising in the cause, they may require
the odicer to conduct them into court. Upon their
being brought into court, the information required must
be given, in the presence of, or after notice to the par-
ties or counsel.
§783. Except as provided in sections 777 and 786,
or in case of some accident or calamity, requiring their
discharge, the jury cannot be discharged after the cause
is submitted to them, until they have agreed upon their
verdict, and rendered it in open court, unless by the
consent of both parties entered upon the minutes, or
unless at the expiration of such time as the court deem
proper, it satisfactorily appear, that there is no proba-
bility of an agreement.
§ 784. In all cases where a jury are discharged, or pre-
vented from giving a verdict, by reason of accident or
other cause, during the progress of the trial, or after the
cause is submitted to them, the action may be again tried,
immediately, or at a future time, as the court directs.
§ 785. While the jury are absent, the court may ad-
journ from time to time, in respect to other business;
but it is nevertheless to be deemed open, for every pur-
pose connected with the cause submitted to the jury,
until a verdict is rendered or the jury discharged. A
final adjournmentof the court discharges the jury.

§ 786. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict,
they must be conducted into court by the oflicer having
them in charge. Their names must then be called;
and if all do not appear, the rest must be discharged
without giving a verdict.
§ 787. If the jury appear, they must be asked by the
court or the clerk, whether they have agreed upon their
verdict; and if the foreman answer `1n the aliirmative,
they must, on being required, declare the same.
§ 788. When a verdict is rendered, and before it is re
corded, the jury may be polled on the request of
either party; for which purpose each juror must be
asked whether it be his verdict; if any one answer in
the negative, the jury must be sent out for further de-
liberation. If the verdict be informal or insufficient, it
may be corrected by the jury under the advice of the
court, or the jury may be again sent out.
§ 789. When the verdict is given, and is such as the
court :Hliy receive, the clerk must immediately record
it in full in the minutes, and must read it to the jury
and inquire of them whether it be their verdict. If any
juror disagree, the fact must be entered in the minutes,
and the jury again sent out; but if no disagreementbe
expressed, the verdict is complete, and the jury mustbe
discharged from the case.

802. Manner of taking and settling exceptions.
803. What exception contains.
§ 801. An exception is an okgection taken at the trial
to a decision upon a matter of law, whether such trial
be by the jury, court, or referees, and whether the de-
cision be made during the formation of a jury, the
production of evidence, the charge to a jury, or at any
other time from the calling of the action for Md to the
rendering of the verdict or decision. But no exception
is to be regarded on a motion for a new trial, or on an
appeal, unless the exception be material, and affect
substantial rights of the party.
This chapter and the next are new, and fill np a space left
in the former code. The provisions explain themselves.
§ 802. The point of the exception must be pa.rt§cu-
lgrly stated, and either deliveredin writing to the judge,
or entered in his minutes, and immediately corrected

or added to, until made conformable to the truth, or it
may afterwards be settled, in a statement of the case,
as provided in section 807.
§803. No particular form of exception is required.
The objection must be stated, with so much of the
evidence as is necessary to explain it, but no more,
and the whole as briefly as possible. If the de-
cision excepted to be verbally made, it must, upon
the exception being taken, be reduced to writing, and
entered either in the judge's minutes, or the minutes of
the court, or in the statement.
It has been too often the practice to encumber ex-
ceptions with details of the evidence, to an unreasonable
length. In most cases, with a little care, all the evidence
necessary to explain the exception can be given in a narrow
wmpass. The following is a bill of egtwqptions, taken in Mas-
sachusetts, Which, for its shortness, is worthy of imitation ;

the party aggrieved, for any of the following causes,
materially affecting the substantial rights of such party :

making the application, which he could not with rea-
sonable diligence have discovered and produced at the
trial:
7. Error in law, occurring at the trial, and excepted
to by the party making the application.
§ 806. When the application is made for a cause,
mentioned in the fourth, Mb, and seventh subdivisions
of the last section, it is made either upon the judge's
minutes, or a statement of the case, preparedzas pre-
scribed in the next section; for any other cause it is
made upon affidavit.
§ 807. The party preparinga statement is to propose a
draft of it, and, within five days after the trial, serve it
upon the adverse party, who may within five days
thereafter, propose amendments to it. If no amend-
ment be proposed, the draft is adopted; if proposed,
the statement and amendments may be submitted En'

trial was had, upon a notice of five days: ifsuch notice

of the case suffcient to pxesent the question.

first instance, be made at a special term, except when
made upon an appeal.
§ eos. The application for a cause mentioned in the
4th and oth subdivisions of section 805 can only be
made, when notice thereo£ oral or written, was given
in open court, immediately after the verdict or other
decision rendered ; and thereupon if the adverse party
consent, the court must appoint a day in the same
term for hearing the application upon the judge's min-
ntes. If however the application be not heard at the
same term, or if an appeal be taken, a statement ofthe
case must be made.

§811. Any party may, and if required by the court,
must when the evidence is closed, submit in distinct
and concise propositions, the conclusions of fact which
he claims to be established, or the conclusions of law,
which he desires to have adjudged, or both; they may
be written and handed to the court, or at the option or
the court, oral and entered in the judge's minutes; but
in either case they must be entered with any excep-
tions that may be taken, if either party require it.
The design of this section is to enable the court referee or
jury to have before them in a definite form the result which
the party seeks to establish. It will be found especially con-
venient in those cases, where the court or referee is required
to find separately on the conclusions of fact and of law, with
a view to their separation, when necessary uponan appeal.
The practice here proposed is but applying to trials on
questions of fact, what the courts have long since required
on appeals, whether they include questions of fact, or those of
law only. The points which each party produces, before ar-
gument, are the same thing as here intended to be made sp-
plicable to the first trial. Although no provision for the prac-
tice exists in any rule of the court, as applicable to the origi-
nal trial, yet in point of fact it has long been used in the oral
summary, which counsel usually present to the court or jury
on the conclusion of a trial.
In some states, it has become a part of the recognized
system of procedure, and with results very beneficial. The
object of this section is to give to the practice a legal sans
tion, and to introduce it in definite form, with a view to fs-
cilitate a more logical analysis of the results of a legal con-
troversy than has sometimes been had.
When the concludons of fact are distinctly pointed out by
counsel, it will necessarily relieve the court from some labor
in preparing ga summary of the facts, inasmuch as it will be
able to decide either in the affirmative or negative, upon the
Digitized by GOO8 le
s40 'rn oonl Ol'
several points, or it can easily modify them to its own con-
clusions.
§ 812. The provisions of this title, respecting trials
by jury, apply, so far as they are in their nature appli-
cable, to trials by the court or referees, and, in the same
manner, the provisions respecting trials by the court
apply to trials by referees.

§ 821. Immediately after entering the judgment, the
clerk must attach together and file the following papers,
which constitute the judgment roll:

ing the judgment. If a statement of the case be made,
the same may be attached to the judgment roll, on the
request of either party, and thenceforth forms a pan
thereof! »
When the defendant is entitled to judgment, if the
plaintiff shall not have filed the summons, with proof
of service and the pleadings on his part, the copies ol'

thereupon the judgment becomes a lien on real proper-
ty in the county, from the time of docketing it therein.
Jlmended Code, § 282.
§823. The lien, mentioned in the last section, ex-
tends to all the real property of the judgment debtor in
the:county, owned by him at the ti me of the judgment,
or afterwards acquired, and continues till the first day
of .July, 1860, on all unsatisfied judgments rendered
or which may be rendered before that time. But after
the first day of January, 1860, there can be no such
lien.
See 2 R. s., ass, §§ a, 4, 5.
This section proposes an important change in respect to the
lien ofjudgments. We believe that the multiplication of liens
upon real property has come to be a serious evil. They are
but embarrassments in the way of the transfer of property. If
all the money collected annually out of real property, upon
judgments a year old, could be ascertained, we believe it would
not equal half the expense paid in the same year upon search-
es for the liens.
The liens of existing judgments cannot be cut oil, and
since they are to continue, it seems proper that subseqeunt
judgments should be put upon the same footing, and the liens of
all cease at the same period. That it may be seen at a glance
how many of these incumbrances upon real property, every
purchaser and every borrower upon mortgage must search
for, we present the following list of them, as they exist in
the city of New-York:

one against the property of the judgment debtor ; an-
other against his person; and the third for the delivery
of the possession of real or personal property, or such
delivery with damages for withholding the same.
They are issued in the name of the people and are
deemed the process of the court, but they need not be
sealed nor subscribed, except as prescribed in the next
section.
./Imended Code, § 286.
§ 828. The writ of execution must be directed to the
sheriff, subscribed by the party issuing it, or his attor-
ney, and must intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating
the court, the county where the judgment roll or
transcript is filed, the names of the parties, the amount
of' the judgment, if it be for money, the amount actual-
ly due thereon, and the time of docketing in the county
to which the execution is issued, and must require the
sheriff substantially as follows:
1. If it be against the property of the judgment debt-
or, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment,
with interest, out of the personal property of such
debtor, and if sullicient personal property cannot be
found, out of his real property, or if the judgment be a
lien on real property, then out of the real property be-
longing to him on the day when the judgment was
docketed in the county, or at any time thereafter, or 

such judgment:
2. If it be against real or personal property, in the
hands of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, lega-
tees, tenants of real property, or trustees, it must re-
quire the sheriif to satisfy the judgment, with interest,
out of such property:
3. If it be against the person of the judgment debtor,
it must require the sheriff to arrest such debtor, and
commit him to the jail of' the county, until he pay the
judgment, with interest, or be discharged according to
law:
4. If it be for the delivery of thepossession of red
or personal property, it must require the sheriff to de-
liver the possession of the same, particularly describing
it, to the party entitled thereto, and may at the same
time require the sheriff to satisfy any costs, charges, dam-
ages, rents or profits recovered by the same judgment,
out of the personal property of the party against whom
it was rendered, and the value of the property for
which the judgment was recovered, to be specified
therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be had, and if suti
licient personal property cannot be found, then out of
real property, as provided in the first subdivision of this
section, and in that respect it is to be deemed an exe-
cution against property.

money or the delivery of real or personal property, the
same is enforced in those respects by execution, as pro-
vided in the last three sections. Where it requires the
performance of any other act, a certified copy of the
judgment may be served upon the party against whom
it is given, or upon the person or oiiicer who is required
thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and his obedience
thereto enforced. If he refuse, he may be punished by
the court, as for a contempt.

judgment, if no execution have been already issued,
an execution can be issued only by leave of the cow
on motion, upon notice to the adverse party. Such
leave must not be given unless it be established by the
oath of the party, or other proof; that the judgment, or
some part thereof; remains unsatisiied and due.
When the judgment has been rendered in a justiods
court, and docketed in the 08m of the clerk of the
county, the application fbr leave to issue execution
must be to the county court of the county where the

gate.
See 2 R. s., aes, § 27.
§ 833. Where the execution is against the property
of the judgment debtor, it may be issued to the sheriff
of any county where the judgment is docketed. Where
it requires the delivery of real or personal property, it
must be issued to the sheriff of the county where the
property or some part thereof; is situated. Executions
may be issued, at the same time, to different counties.

article exempt from an execution issued on a judg-

exemption should be carried still further, so as to save the
homestead of a family, is a high question of public policy,
which it is for the legislature alone to entertain.

CIVIL nocnnunr.. aaa
It has been for some years the policy of our laws to allow
a redemption of real property upon sales on execution. 2 R.
S. 370, § 45-62. Whether this policy is founded in sound
principles, or even affords any beneit to the debtor, has been
seriously questioned by judicious men. The Commissioners
do not deem it expedient for them to propose to abolish re-
demptions, but there are some features in the existing system
which are unnecessary, and so clearly indefensible that they
have felt it a duty to endeavor, by a change, to make it more
conducive to the real policy of the law ; favor to an unfortu-
nate debtor, and the appropriation of his properiy in such
manner as to pay the largest possible amount of his debts. _
The existing system presents the following, among other
results »
It, in effect, delays the collection of a debt out of real pro-
perty, for lifteen months after the sale;
It suspends the remedy of all junior judgment creditors
against the same property for the same period ;
If redeemed upon judgment or other lien, the redemption
efects no payment on the lien debt, but the creditor takes the
debtor's land by redemption, and keeps his debt against him
also in full force, and may sell other property upon it in the
same manner as if he had not redeemed; even if paid after
wards, the payment does not restore the land .
Although the provisions proposed by the Commissioners do
not wholly obviate these objections, they at least have that
tendency.
There seems no good reason for the great lapse of time
heretofore allowed, nor for preventing the debtor from re-
deeming his land at any time while it is open for redemption
to a creditor. The uncertainty whether the holder of the
oldest lien will redeem,and the advantage of waiting until
the last hour, in case he fails, has often led to subsequentliti-
gation. The plan the Commissioners offer, partially obviate:
at least these objections.

redemption the court may restrain the commission of

eution, or his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom
in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings con-

if the recovery was in consequence of the irregularity,
'shall thereupon be entitled to a new execution on the
judgment, for the price paid on the sale with interest;
and for ' that purpose the judgment shall be deemed
'wid against the judgment debtor, his personal repre-

ser in good faith, or an incumbrancer, whose title or

TITLE Xl.
ACTIONS IN PARTICULAR CASES.
Cl!/urnzn I. Action: to determine conflicting claims to real property and other
provisions relating to aaions concerning real property.
II. Actions for the foreclosure of mortgages.
m. Actions for nuisance, waste, trespass on Indian lands, and wilful
trespass on other real property.
IV. Actions for the partition of real property.
V. Actions respecting corporations.
VI. Actions by or against executors, administrators, legatees, heirs, or

VIII. Actions by and against certain public odicers, and public bodies.
IX. Actions to vacate charters, letters patent, and to prevent the usurps~
tion of an odice or franchise.
X. Actions in justices' courts.
The form of civil actions under the code, is in its nature
adapted to almost every case requiring the interposition of
judicial authority. In making provisions for proceedings in
special cases, it has been deemed wise to conform as far as
practicable, to the system already adopted in civil actions,
and to make provision for the points of difference only. By
this means the advantage is afforded of following the beaten
track already enlightened by the judicial consideration to
which the code has been subjected. The length and number
of statutory enactments, are by the same means greatly abridg-
ed. This remark is applicable not only to most of the pro-
visions under this title, but also to the special proceedings
for which rules are prescribed in part 3.
By comparing the provisions with those of the revised stat-
utes on the same subject, it will be found that the volume of
matter has been greatly reduced, while it contains, as we be
lieve. a more certain, safe and simple mode of procedure in
every case.

R. S., part 3, chap. 5, lille 2.
The salutary provisions of this entire title are secured in the
two preceding sections. The form of action under the code
being adapted to these cases, it only requires a provision de
claring them the subject of an action, and regulating the
judgment, when the defendant disclaims, or makes no defence.

380 THE coma or
§ 890. In an action, for the recovery of flower before
admeasurement, or by a tenant in common, or joint
tenant of real property, against a co~tena.nt, the plaintiff
must show, in addition to the evidence of his right, that
the defendant either denied the plaintiffs right, or did
some act amounting to such denial.
The provisions of the Revised Statutes are extended, so as
to include actions for the recovery of dowel-net set- oE, as
coming within the reason of the rule whieh applies to other
tenants in common.
§ 891. In an action for the- recovery of speciiic real
or personal property, where the plaintiff shows a right
to. recove: at the time the action was-commenced, but
it appears that hisright has terminated during the pen-
dency of the action, the verdict andjudgment must be
accord.ing to the fact, and the plaintiff? may recover
damages for withholding the property.
The provisions of the Revised Statutes extended, so as to
include actions for specific personal property as well as real-
§ 892. Any person, against whom a judgment for the
recovery of specific real property is» rendered may,
within six. months- after written noticeof thejudgment.;
upon payment of all costs. and damages recovered
thereby, demand another trial, by notice in- writing. IQ

thereupon the action may be brought to trial by either

=toit, with peculiar caution and jealousy of the courts. This
arises from the source whence we have drawn most of our syl-
tem of judicial policy, and is the legitimate descendant of
feudal times in England. But a few years since real proper
ty could not be sold on execution. Until the Revised Stat-
utes, a judgment in ejectment, though based exclusively on
evidence of title, decided nothing but the right of .possession
for the time being, and other actions might be brought the
next day by the defendant to recover back the same pro-
pony.
:By the Revised Statutes, when the action by writ of right
was abolished and ejectment substituted, the judgment was
made conclusive upon the title, but the losing party was al
lowed three years to pay the costs and demand a new trial
If unsuccessfulhgain, he might even then within two years ap
ply to the court for another new trial.
There seems no good reason for allowing so long a period,
within which an unsuccessful party may determine whether, to
submit to the result of the first trial. After a second trial,
with a similar result, the judgment ought to be conclusive.
The remaining sections of this title embrace all the remain
ing provisions of the existing laws relating to actions con
°cerning real property, which the Commissioners deem ne
oessamy.

the parties. If a prior judgment shall have been execu-
ted, restitution must be ordered, as the last judgment
may determine the rig'1ts of the parties, and the same
may be enforced by execution.
§895. Damages for withholding the property re-
covered, can in no case exceed the fair value of the
property, (exclusive of the use of improvements, made
by the defendant,) for a period not exceeding six years;
and when permanent improvements have been made
by a defendant, or those under whom he claims, hold-
ing under color ot" title, adversely to the claims of the
plaintiff; in good faith, the value thereof must be
allowed as a set-off against thc damages of the plaintiff;
for the use of the property.
§896. The court, in which an action is pending for
the recovery of real property, may on motion, upon
notice, by either party, and for cause shown, grant an
order, allowing fo such party the right to enter upon
the property, and make survey and measurement there-
of for the purposes of the action.
§897. The order must describe the property, and a
copy theref must be served on the owner, or occupant,
and thereupon such party may enter upon the property
with necessary surveyors and assistants, and make such
survey and measurements, but if any unnecessary in-
jury be done to the property he is liable therefor.

§898. A mortgage of 'real property is not to be
deemed a conveyance, so as to enable the owner of the
mortgage to recover possession of the real property,
without a foreclosure.
§ 899. The court may, by injunction, on cause shown,
restrain the party in possession, from doing any ict to
the injury of real proper1y, during the summary fore-
closure of a mortgage thereon, or after a sale on execu-
tion, before a conveyance.
§900. When real property shall have been sold on
execution, the purchaser thereof; or any person, who
may have succeeded to his interest, may, after his es-
tate becomes absolute, recover damages for injury
to the property, by the tenant in possession, after the
sale, and before possession is delivered under the con-
veyance.
§901. An action for the recovery of real property
against a person in possession, or in the receipt of the
rents or profits thereof; can not be prejudiced by any
alienation, made by such person, either before or alter
the commencement of the action; but in such case, if
the defendant have no property sufiicient to satisfy the
damages recovered, for the Withholding of possession,
such damages may be collected by action against the
purchaser.

bring an action to recover possession of the property;
and such action is equivalent to a demand of the rent
and a re-entry upon the property. But if at any tiMe
before the expiration of six months after possession ob-
tained by the plaintiH, on recovery in the action, the
lessee, or his successor in interest as to the whole or
part of the property, pay to the plaintiff, or bring into
court, the amount of rent then in arrear with interest,
and the costs of the action, and perform the other co-
venanls on the part of the lessee, he may be restored to
the possession and hold the property according to the
terms ofthe original lease.

906. Surplus on sale.
WY. SuMcient to satisfy debt only to be sold.
This chapter contains all the provisions deemed necessary
in actions for foreclosure of mortgages, which are substituted
for the provisions formerly in use for that purpose. When
mortgages are given for the payment of money only, as most
of them are, ample provisions are made in part 3, for their
foreclosure in a summary, and as we think safe manner. In
cases other than those, the action of the court, in determining
the amount is almost invariably necessary ; and these are the
only cases in which a mortgage foreclosure will necessarily
be by action.
§ 903. In an action for the foreclosure or satisfhction
of a mortgage of real property, or the satisfaction of is
Digitized by GOO8 le
crvu. nocmun. ` 385
lien or incumbrance upon Pr°Pf=rfy» real or personal,
the court has power, by its judgment, to direct a sale
of the property, or any part of it ; the application of the
proceeds to the payment of the amount due on the
mortgage, lien, or incumbrance with costs; and execu-
tion, for the balance, against any party liable therefor,
as principal, eurety, or otherwise.
§ 904. Real property adjudged to be sold, must be
sold in the county where it lies, by the sheriff of the
county, or by a referee, appointed by the court for that
purpose, and thereupon the sheriff or referee must exe-
cute a conveyance to the purchaser, which conveyance
passes the title of the parties to the action. And upon
the sale of property, real or personal, pursuant to a
judgment, the court may enforce the delivery of poa-
session thereof to the purchaser.
§ 905. When a debt is secured by mortgage of real
or personal property, or a lien or incumbrancc thereon,
separate actions respecting the debt and the security
cannot be allowed, but the creditor must include in one
action all his claims upon both.
To prevent multiplicity of actions.
§906. If there be surplus money, remaining after
paymenfof the amount mentioned in section 903, the
court may cause the same to he paid to the person en-
titled to it, and in the mean time, may direct it to be
deposited in court.

§ 907. If the debt, for which the mortgage, lien or
incumbrance is held, be not all due, so soon as sutl
ficient of the property has been sold to pay the amount
due, with costs the sale must cease; and afterwards as
often as more becomes due, for principal or interest,
the court may, on motion, order more to be sold. But
if the property cannot be sold in portions, without in-
jury to the parties, the whole may be ordered to be sold
in the first instance, and the entire debt and costs be
paid, there being a°rebate of interest, where such rebate
'is proper.

by any person whose property is iujuriously affected, or
whose personal enjoyment islessened by the ndsance ;

and by the judgment, the nuisance may be enjoined or
abated, as well as damages recovered.
§ 909. If a guardian, tenant by the curtesy, in dower,
for life or years, joint tenant or tenant in common of
real property, commit waste thereon, any person ag
grieved by the waste, may bring an action against him
therefor, in which action, there may be judgment for
treble damages, forfeiture of the estate of the party of
fending, and eviction from the property.
§ 910. Judgment of forfeiture and eviction can only
be given, in favor of the person entitled to the rever
sion, against the tenant in possesdon, when .the injury
to the estate in reversion is adjudged in the action, to
be equal to the value of the tenant's estate or unex
pired term, or to have been done in malice.
The injuries known at common law by the expressive terms
of waste and nuisance, have been heretofore remediable only
by special waits and a peculiar form of proceeding, or by suit
in chancery. The injuries themselves are not defined in the
revised statutes, but are left to be gleaned from the reports of
common law cases, and elementary writers, while the method
of proceeding to obtain redress is delined at some length
The system of civil actions in the code is perfectly well ad
apted to these cases, and it only requires a definition of them
suHiciently comprehensive to prevent the loss of a remedy,
and to dware them within the cases for which an ordinary
action may be brought.
This the commissioners believe they have accomplished by
these provisions. The necessity is dispensed with for the spe
cial write and peculiar proceedings for whichthose parts of
the revised statutes were -enacted.

§ 911. Every person who cuts down, or carries 081
any wood or underwood, tree or timber, or girdles or
otherwise injures any tree, timber or shrub on the land
of another person, or on the street or highway, in front
of any person's house, village or city lot, or cultivated
grounds, or on the commons, or public grounds, of any
city or town, or on the street or highway, in front
thereof, without lawful authority, is liable to the owner
of such land, or to such city or town, for treble the
amount of damages, which may be assessed therefor,
in a civil action, in any court having jurisdiction, ex-
cept as provided in the next section.
The uses to which a penalty is attached for wilful treipan,
extended so~as to include ornamental trees in the streets.
§ 9122. 18 upon the trial of such action, it appear, that
the trespass was casual or involuntary, or that the de-
fendant had probable cause to believe, that the land, on
which the trespass was committed, was his own, or
that of the person in whose service, or by whose direc-
tion, the act was done, judgment must be given for
only the single damages assessed in the action.
§ 913. Nothing in the last two sections authorises the
recovery of more than the just value of the timber, ta-
ken from uncultivated wood land, for the repair of a
public highway or bridge upon the land or adjoining it.

are assessed.
§ 915. In case of forcible entry or forcible detention,
if a person claiming in good faith, under color of title,
to be rightfully in possession, so put out or kept out,
recover damages therefor, judgment may be entered in
his favor, for three times the amount, at which the ac-
tual damages are assessed.
§ 916. For trespass, by any person other than an In-
dian, on lands possessed by Indians, an action may be
brought in the name of the people of this state.
§ 917. Such action must be prosecuted by the district
attorney of the county where the lands are situated, or
'by an attorney to be designated for that purpose, by the
county judge.
§ 918. The damages recovered in such action, afler
defraying the expenses of the prosecution, must be dis-
tributed among the Indians occupying such lands, ac-
cording to their respective interests therein, to be de-
termined by the county judge, on summary application
before him.

This proceeding is one of those which has existed heretofone,
separate from the ordinary forms of actions, by special statu-
tory provisions in detail, providing for its prosecution in both
courts of law and equity.
The nature of the remedy is so unlike those sought in or-
dinary actions, as to require many distinct provisions, differing
from the general course of procedure.
We have endeavored to unite all that was valuable in the
old law and equity modesof practice, and to make the proce-
dure conform as far as the nature of the remedy admits, to
the procedure in ordinary actions. There are such a variety
of interests and contingencies to be guarded and provided for
that the provisions necessarily occupy a considerable space
though condensed into nearly half the volume,they have here-
tofore occupied in the revised statutes. Among other improve-
ments in the system heretofore in use, is that by which, in case
of a sale of property, the proceeds, whether money or securi-
ties, may, in certain cases, be paid or delivered directly to the
parties interested, without the tedious and expensive ceremony
of being tirst paid into court, and afterwards taken out on s
formal application.
See 2 R. S., 316-332.
§ 92n. Wherrseveral persons hold, and are in posses-
sion ofreal property, as joint tenants or as tenants in
common,~in which one or more of them have an estapi,
Digitized by GOO8 le
392 mx cons or
of inheritance, or for life or years, an action may be
brought by one or more of such persons, for a partition
thereof; according to the respective rights of the persons
interested therein, and for a sale of such property, or a
part of it, if it appear that a partition cannot be made,
without great prejudice to the owners.
§ 921. The summons must be addressed by name to
all the joint tenants, and tenants in common, who are
known, and generally to all persons unknown, having
or claiming an interest in the property.
§ 922. The interests of all persons in the property,
whcilwr such persons be known or unknown, must be
set forth in the complaint specifically and particularly,
as far as known to the plaintiff, and if any one or more
of the parties, or the share or quantity of interest of any
of the parties, be unknown to thc plaintiff] or be uncer-
tain or contingent, or the ownership of the inheritance
depend upon executory devise, or the remainder be a
contingent remainder, so that such parties can not be
named, that fact must be set forth in the complaint.
§ 928. The plaintiff may at his option, make credit-
ora, having a specific or general lien upon the property
or upon any particular portion thereof] parties to the ac-
tion.
§ 924. When the lien is on an undivided interest or
estate of any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be
made, is thenceforth a charge only on the shane assign-
od to such party; but such share must be first charged
Digitized by GOO8 le
avm noouwu.. 893
with its just proportion of the costs of the partition, in
preference to such lien.
§ 925. If a party having a share or interest be un-
known, or either of the known parties reside out of the
state or cannot be found therein, and such fact be made
to appear by affidavit, the summons may be served on
such absent or unknown party, by publication, directed
by the court or judge, in the manner prescribed by sec-
tions 629 and 680. When publication is made, the
summons, as published, must be accompanied by a
brief description of the property, which is the subject
of the action.
§ 926. The rights of .the several parties, plaintitlh, as
well as defendants, may be put in issue, tried and de-
termined by such action ; and where a defendant fails
to answer, or where a sale of the premises is necessary,
the title must be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction
of the court, before the judgment for parfition or sale
is given.
§ 927. If it be alleged in the complaint, and estab-
lished by evidence, to the satisfaction of the court, that
the property or any part of it is so situated, that parti-
tion cannot be made, without great prejudice to the
owners, the court may order a sale thereof] and for that
purpose may appoint one or more referees. Otherwise,
upon the requisite proofs being made, it must order a
partition, according to the respective rights of the par-
Digitized by GOO8 le
394 ml: cob: or
ties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint three
referees therefor; and must designate the portion to
remain undivided, for. the owners, whose interests
remain unknown or not ascertained.
§928. In making the partition, referees must divide
the property, and allot the several portions thereof' to
the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively
considered, according to the respective rights of the
parties, as determined by 'the court, designating the
several portions by proper landmarks, and may employ
a surveyor, with the necessary assistants, to aid them
tlierein.
§Q29. The referees must make report of their pro-
ceedings, specifing therein the manner of executing
their trust, describing the property divided, and the
shares allotted to each party, with a particular descrip-
tion of each share.
§ 930. The court may confirm or set aside the report,
and if necessary, appoint new referees. Upon the re-
port being confirmed, judgment must be rendered, that
such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is
binding and conclusive:
1. On all the parties named therein, and their legal~
representatives, who have at the time any interest in
the property divided, as owners in fee, or as tenants ibr
years, or as entitled to the reverdon, remainder or in-
heritance of such property, after the termination of a
Digitized by GOO8 le
mm rnoamuu.. ass-
particular estate therein: or who, by any contingency,
may be entitled toa beneficial interest in the property,
or who have an interest in~an individual share thereof;
as tenants for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower:
2. On all persons interested in the property, who may
be unknown, to whom notice shall have been given of
the application for partition by the publication directed
by section 925-: and,
<3. On .all~other persons claiming from such parties or
persons, or either of them.
§ 931. But such judgment ahd partition cannot affect
tenants, or persons having claims as tenant~, in dower,
by the curtesy or for life, to the whole of the property,
which is the subject of the partition; nor can such
judgment and partition preclude any person, except
such as are specified in the' last section, iiomclainiing
title to the property in question, or from controvezipg,
the title of the parties between whom the partition il
made.
§ 932. The expenses of the referees, including those
of a surveyor and his assistants, when employed. must
be ascertained and allowed by the court; and the
amount thereof; together with the fees allowed by law
to the referees, must be paid by the plaintiff] and may
be allowed aspart of the charges.
§933. If the referees report to the court, that the
property, of which partition shall have been directed,
Digitized by GOO8 le
396 1-sx oonmor
or any distinct portion thereof; is so situated, that a
partition thereof cannot be made, without great preju-
dice to the owners; and the court is satisfied that such
report is correct, it may thereupon, by an order, direct
the referees to sell the property, or portion so situated.
§934. When a part of the property only is ordered
to be sold, if there be an estate by the curtesy, in dow-
er, or for life or years, in an undivided share of the
property, the whole of such estate may be set 0E in
any part of the property not ordered to be sold.
§ 935. Before the making of an order for sale, where
the creditors having specific liens have not been made
parties, the court, on the motion of either party, must
direct the plaintiff to amend his complaint, if necessa-
ry, bv making every person having a specific lien on
the undivided interest or estate of any of the parties by
mortgage, devise or otherwise, a party to the action
§ 986. The plaintiff must produce to the court the
certificate of the clerk of the county where the proper-
ty issituated, showing whether there are any general
liens by judgment upon the property, or any part there-
o£
§937. Unless it be made to appear to the court by
the certificate of the clerk pursuant to the last section,
that there are outstanding no general liens on the pro-
Digitized by GOO8 le
cxvu noalwn. 897
peny, or on any share or parcel thereof] the court must
order a reference to ascertain them.
§ 938. If it appear by the certificate that there are out-
standing of record such general liens, the court must
appoint a referee to ascertain whether such liens have
been paid, or if not paid, what amount remains due or
secured by them respectively, and the order of priority
in which they are entitled to be paid out of the pro-
perty.
§ 939. The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served,
at least ten days before the time for appearance, on
each person having such general lien, to appear before
the referee at a specified time and place, to make proof
by his own affidavit or otherwise, of the true amount
due, or to become due, contingently or absolutely, on
his judgment.
§940. The referee must receive the evidence, and
report,the names of the creditors whose liens are es-
tablished, the amounts thereof; and their priority re
spectively, and if such liens are contingent he must
specify them. He must attach to his report the proof
of service of the notices, and the aiiidavits and copies
of other evidence before him.
§ 941. Any creditor having a lien, and being dissatis-
fied with the report of the referee, may move the court
to correct it, at any time.bef`ore distribution of the pro-
ceeds of sale, on ten days' notice to the plaintiff and
Digitized by GOO8 le
ass 'mn ooo: or
the other persons in whose favor liens arereported, and
thereupon the court may correct the report on the evi-
dence reported, or if necessary, may order a new refer-
ence of the whole or of any part of the matter. When
confirmed, the report is conclusive of the rights of the
several creditors on whom notice was served.
§942. The proceeds of the sale of the incumbered
property, must be applied under the direction of the
court, as follows:
1 1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of
the action:
2. To pay the costs of the reference:
3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens
in their order of priority, by payment of the sums due
and to become due, the amount remaining due to be
verified by afiidavit at the time of payment:
4. The residue, among the owners of the property
- sold, according to their respective shares therein.
§948. The proceedings to ascertain the amount of
incumbranoes, and to determine their priority as above
provided, or those herein authorized to determine the
rights of parties, to funds paid into court, must not de-
lay the sale, nor affect any other party, whose rights
are not involved in such proceedings.
Q 944. 'The proceeds of sale, arid the éecurities takeh
by the referees, or any part thereof; may be distributed
Digitized by GOO8 le

by them to the persons entitled thereto, whenever the
court so directs. But in case no direction be given, all
such proceeds and securities must be paid into court, or
deposited as required by law, or directed by the court.
§ 945. When the proceeds of sales of any shares or
parcels, belonging to persons, who have become parties
to the action, and who are known, are paid into court,
the action may be continued as between such parties,
for the determination of their respective claims thereto,
whichmust be ascertained andadjudge&- bythe court.
Further testimony may be taken, in court, or by a re-
feree, at the discretion of the-court, and the court may,
if necessary, require such parties to present the facts
or law in controversy, by pleadings, as in an original
action.
§ 946. All sales of real property, made by referees
under this chapter, must be made by public auction to
the highest bidder, upon notice, published in the man-
ner required for the sale of real property on execution.
The notice must state the terms of sale, and if the pro-
petty or any part of it is to be sold, subject to a prior
estate, charge or specific lien, that must be stated in
the notice.
§947. The court must, in the order for sale, direct
theterms of credit which may be allowed, for the pur-
chase money, of any portion of the premises of which
it may direct a sale on credit, and for that portion of
which the purchase money is required, by the provis-

ions hereinafter contained, to be invested for the bene-
fit of unknown owners, infants, parties out of the state,
or tenants in dower, or by the curtesy, or for life or
years, when the estate of such tenats is ordered to be
sold.
§ 948. The referees may take separate mortgages and
other securities, for the whole or convenient portions of
the purchase money, or such parts of the property as are
directed by the court to be sold on credit in the name
of the clerk of the court and his successors in oilice,
and for the shares of any known owner of full age, in
the name of such owner.
§ 949. When the estate of a tenant in dower, or by
the curtesy, or for life or years, in the whole or anypart
of the property in question has been admitted by the
parties, or ascertained by the court, to be existing at the
time ofthe order for sale, and the person entitled to such
estate, has been made a party to the action, such estate
may be first set off out of any part of the property, and
a sale make of such parcel, subject to the prior unsold
estate of such tenant dierein, But if in the judgment
of the court, a due regard to the interests ofall the par-
ties, require that such estate be also sold the sale may
be so ordered.
§ 950. If a sale of the property, including such estate,
be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant
or person passes thereby; and the purchaser, his
heirs and assigns, shall hold the property discharged

whether the same be to the individual share of a joint
tenant, or tenant in common, or to the whole or any
part of the property sold.
§ 951. The persons entitled to such estate in dower,
tenancy by the curtesy, or tenancy for life or years,

entitled may consent to accept instead thereof, by an
instrument under seal, duly acknowledged or proved, in
in same manner as deeds for the purpose of record.
' § 952. If such consent be not given, at or before the
report of sale, the court must ascertain and determine
what proportion of the proceeds of the sale, after de-

be invested, for the benefit of the person entitled to such
estate, in dower, by the curtesy, or for life ; and must
order the same to be deposited in court for that pur-
pose,

The provisions of this chapter afford substantially the same
remedies as are provided for in articles 1 and 2, title 4, chap-
ter 8, part 3 of the revised statutes, changed so as to conform
to the uniform system of procedure under the code in actions.
The necessity of some parts of those articles is dispensed with
by other parts of the code applicable to such cases. This
chapter was prepared before the publication of the Session
Laws of 1849, and consequently without adverting to the pro-
visions of the act of that session. chapter 226, making pro-
visions to enforce the liabilities of banks under the article of the
constitution on that subject. On examination of that article, it is
found, that its provisions, which are not confined to banking
corporations, do not conflict with those of this chapter, but
that its special provisions are entirely in harmony with the
rules of more general application here prescribed. Consider-
ing the recent enactment of that statute, and that it is not
only confined to banks and banking associations, but to debts
contracted after lst January, 1850, the Commissioners have
not deemed it necessary or expedient either to attempt a re
vision of it, or to introduce it into the code, but rather to leave
it as a special law applicah'e to the particular cases embraced
within it.

§974. This chapter embraces all corporations, in-
cluding in such designation, all associations having
any corporate rights, whether created by special acts
of legislation, or under general laws; except that nw
part of the chapter, other than the next section, ex-
tends to a municipal, or religious corporation, or to a
corporation for a public library, a cemetery, an acade-
my, or a society for literary or charitable purposes, or
for the encouragement of the fine arts, unless such cor-
poration has by its charter, or the law cf its organiza-
tion, shares or stock, from Which, in some contingency,
a dividend may be made.
The term corporation as used in the constitution and laws
of this state in general, includes municipal bodi°s with cor-
porate powers. These and the other corporations specially
exempted in this section, are not clearly within the policy of
provisions of this chapter, though by the terms of the Revised
Statutes, vol. 2, p. 4667 sec. 57, only religious societies, in-
corporated libraries, and Lancasteriau schools are specially
exempted.
§ 975. A foreign corporation cannot maintain an ac-
tion inthis state, upon an obligation or liability, aris-
ing out of; or in consideration of an act, which is con-
trary to the law or policy of this state, or which is
thereby forbidden, in respect to corporations or associ-
ations therein, whose general business is similar to that
of such foreigri corporation.
§ 976. When judgment is rendered against a bank, or
banking association, for any bill or other contract, for
the absolute payment of money, payment of which has

been refused, on presentment al. the bank, or place of
business of the defendant, the plaintiff may recover in-~
terest, at the rate of tenper cent a year, from the time=
of such refusai, unless in the act of incorporation, a,
different rate of interest, or measure of damages, has
been prescribed.
§ 977. A corporation may be restrained. by injunction,
provisional or final, from, exercising .any function or
doing anyact not allowed by law. Such injunction
may be granted upon the application of the attorney
general, or other officer authorized by statute, on satis-
factory evidence that the corporation has usurped,
exercised or claimed a franchise, privilege, or other cor-
porate right, not authorized by law, or has done or sufl
fared some other act, by which its corporate existence
or rights have become forfeited, or may by authority of~
law, be terminated.
§978. The supreme court has jurisdiction over all
corporations, and the directors, managers, trustees and
other ofiicers thereof;
1. To compel an officer to account for -his official
conduct in the management and disposition of its busi-
ness or property:
2.» To suspend an officer from exercising his func-
tions, when it appears that he has abused his trust :
3. To compel the payment, or delivery, by an oficer
to such corporation, or to its creditors, of any money
Digitized by GOO8 le
419 T82 mul or
or property of such corporation, or the avails thereof,
in his hands, or to pay the value of; or to deliver over,
any property he may have misapplied, or wasted, or ac-
quired to himself; or withheld, in violation of his duty:
4. To remove an ofiicer from his oflice on proof of
gross misconduct :
5. To direct a new election to be held, to supply a
vacancy, occasioned by such removal or otherwise:
6. In case such vacancy cannot be filled by the cor-
poration, then to report the facts to the governor, who
is hereby authorized to fill it:
7. To set aside alienations of property made by an
officer contrary to the provisions of law, or for purposes
foreign to the business of the corporation, in cases
where it may be done without injustice to the purcha-
ser or holder:
8 To prevent the improper alienation or disposition
of property, where there is reason to apprehend it will
be made.
But this jurisdiction does not deprive any corporate
body, or public ofiicer, of visitatorial power over any
corporation.
§ 979. The jurisdiction conferred by the last section
can only be exercised on the application of an autho-
rized public officer, or of a creditor or stockholder, and
the proceedings must be by action, in all proper cases;
in other cases by motion.

§ 980. Whenever the affairs cf' a corporation are
closed by the supreme court, (except on a judgment,
obtained by a creditor for the satisfaction of a debt,)
the creditors are entitled to be paid ratably in propor-
tion to the amount of their respective demands, as as-
certained under the direction of the court, except, that,
in case of the insolvency of a bank or banking associ-
ation, the bill-holders thereof are entitled to preference
in payment over other creditors.
§ 981. A corporation may be adjudged to have forfeit-
ed its corporate rights, in either of the following cases:
1. When it has for one year neglected to pay its
notes, or other evidences of debt, or has, for that period,
suspended its ordinary and lawful business:
2. When, having banking powers, or authority to
make loans on pledgf-s or deposits, or to make insu-
rance, it violates any of the provisions of the act under
which it is incorporated, or of any other law.
§ 982. Any corporation mentioned in the last section,
may be restrained by injunction from the further exer#
cise of its corporate rights, and from receiving, paying,
transferring, or delivering any money or other property,
until the court otherwise order; and in that case, a re-
ceiver of the corporate property may be appointed.
Such injunction may be granted in an action brought
by the attorney general, in behalf' of' the state, to close
the business of the corporation, or by a creditor or
stockholder, in an action to have such forfeiture ad-
judged.

§ 988. If the action '=be brought by a creditor of a
corporation, whosedirectors, .ofllcers or stockholders
are, by law, persona'ly liable for its debts, either abso-
lutely or in any contingency, theymay be made parties
to the action, either at it*s -commencement or wbse-
quently, forthe purpofse of enf`orcing'such liability.
§ 984. \Vhe4n a judgmvnt has been rendered in 'such
action, whether brought by theattorney general, or by
a stockholder or creditor, and the directors, of ficers or
stockholders are personally liable for the debts, and
have not been made parties, any creditor may com-
mence an action, founded upon such judgment, to en-
force the liability; and in such action, the former judg-
ment is conclusive evidence of the matters therein
adjudged.
§ 985. Whenever an execution, issued on a judgment
against a corporation, is returned unsatisfied in whole
or in part, by the sheriffof the county, where the prin-
cipal ofhce or place of business of the corporation is
situated, and whenever a corporation is adjudged to
have forfeited its corporate rights, the courtmust cause
its affairs to be closed, its debts collected, its .property
converted into money, and its creditors paid in propor-
tion to the amount of their respective debts, in the or-
der ,provided in a case of -a voluntary dissolution of a
corporation, except that the bill-holders of an insolvent
bank or banking association, must be preferred, as -pro-
vided in section 980.

§ 986. VVhen the property of the corporation is insuf-
ficient to discharge its debts, the court may compel
each stockholder fo pay any amount, that may remain
unpaid, on the shares of stock held by him, or so much
thereof, as is necessary to satisfy the debts, and when
the officers or stockholders are personally liable for the
debts, and the property of the corporation, together with
the amount unpaid on the stock, is insuflicient to dis-
charge its debts, the court may compel contribution
from the offict-rs or stockholders, who may be liable to
satisfy the balance of the debts, from each according
to his liabil;ty.
§987. In any proceeding, pursuant to this chapter,
to close the affairs of' a corporation, the court may, an
application of a stockholder, oflicer or creditor, restrain
further proceedings by any creditor, inan action against
the corporation, so far as may be -proper, in order to
prevent the waste of the funds by unnecessary litiga-
tion; and may by a notice, served or published as the
court may direct, require all creditors to present and
prove their claims, or become .parties to the action,
within a reasonable time, or be precluded from the
benefit of any distribution, which may be made before
such claim is proved.

§ 1000. In such action, the plaintiff may recover the
value of all the assets received by all the defendants in
the action, if necessary to satisfy his demand ; and the
amount of the recovery must be apportioned among
the defendants; in proportion to the value of the assets
received by each ; and no allowance or deduction can
be made from such amount, on account of there being
other relatives to whom assets have also been de-
livered.
§ 1001. Any one of the next of kin, against whom a
recovery is had pursuant to the last section, may
maintain an action against all the other relatives of the
testator, to whom any such assets have been paid, joint-
ly, or against any of them separately, for a just and equad
contribution, and may recover of each defendant such
an amount as shall be in the same proportion to the
whole sum collected of the plaintiff as the value of the
assets delivered to such defendant bore to the value of
all the assets delivered to all the relatives of the de-
qeased.

§ 1002. Legatees are liable to an action by acreditor
of the testator to recover the value of any legacy re-
ceived by them. The action may be brought againét
all or only one of the legatees. In such action the
,plaintiff cannot recover unless he shows: s
1. That no assets were delivered by the executor br
administrator of the deceased, to his next of kin: or"
2. That the value of such assets has been recoveregi
by some other creditor: or
3. That such assets are not sufBcient to satisfy tho
demand of the plaintiff:
And in the last case, he can recover only the deficien-
cy. The whole amount which the plaintiff can recover,
must be apportioned among all the legatees of the tes-
~tator, in proportion to the amounts of their legacies re-
spectively, and his proportion can only be recovered of
each legatee.
§ 1003. If an action be brought against several next
of kin jointly, or against several legatees jointly, for
.assets delivered to them, and a recovery be had against

§ 1012. If a debt of a class prior to that on which the

This chapterdiifers from the Revised Statutes, chiPHy in
making the rules applicable to all official securities uniform,
and in allowing a prosecution upon them, directly in the
name of the party aggrieved, instead of doingthe same thing
indirectly in the name of the people. As in most of the
other special cases in this title, the change in the system of
procedure has enabled the Commissioners to condense the
subject into less than half its length in the Revised Statutes.
See 2, R. s., 476-483.
§ 1022. The omcialwnd, or other security, of a pub-
lic officer, to the people of this state, whether with or
without sccuiities, is to be construed as security to the
people of the state, as a government, and also to all
persons severally, for the otlicial delinqucncies, against
which it is intended to provide. If` it be to a county,
town, city, village or other municipal body, it is, in like
manner, to be constrnvd as security severally to all per-
sons intended to be se<~tncd, as well as to the body p0°
litic named the"uin.

§ 1023. When a public oiiicer, by official misconduct
or neglect of duty, forfeits his of'dcial bond, or renders
his sureties liable upon an oflicial security, any person
injured thereby, or who is, by law, entitled to the bene-
lit of the security, may bring an action thereon, in 114
own name, against the otlicer and his sureties, to re-
cover the amount to which he may be entitled, by rea-
son of the delinquency. |
§ 1024. Before an action can be brought by a plaim
Iifll other than the people, or body politic named in the
security, leave must be obtained of the court or a judge
thereof, or a county judge, within the district or county
where the action is triable; and leave can only be
granted, on a production of the copy of the bond, and
an aflidavit showing the delinquency; and if the de-
linquency be such, as that if established on the trial, it
would entitle the party applying to recover in the ac-
tion, leave must be granted.
§ 1025. A judgment in favor of a party for one dei
linquehcy, does not preclude the same, or another party,
from an action on the same security, for another delin-
quency.
§ 1026. If it appear in an action against a surety, on
an ofhcial security, that he has already been obliged,
by reason of prior recoveries against him on the same,
to pay amounts, which, in the aggregate, are equal to
the exteut of his undertaking, or that, by reason of the

Making.
§ 1027. Upon the execution issued on a judgment,
recovered upon the ofiicial security of a public oflicer
against him and a surety, there must be endorsed a di-
faction to tihe otiicer, to whom the 'execution it deliv-

fhe aggregule to 8 sum greater than that, for which the
si1'ret:ies are liable, the court mus', oh their application,
limit the amount to be collected of them, to the amouni
of their respective liabilities, and may cause the same
to be appliecl on the judgments or executions, in pro-
portion to such amounts.
§ 1029. Actions for fines and forfeitures, may be 'pro-
secuted by the oflicers or persons, to whom they are by
law given, or who, by special provision of law, are au-
thorised to .recover them; and whether prosecuted by
public ofiicers, or by private persons, are governed by

which is limited bylaw, not to exceed a certain amount»
the action may be brought for that amount ; and upon
the trial, the amount recovered, must be determined in
proportion to the offence.
§ 103 l. A recovery of ajudgment, for a penalty or a
forfeiture, by collusion between the parties, with intent
to save the defendant .from the consequences contem-
plated by law, in a case where the penalty or forfeiture
is given, wholly or partly. to the prosecutor, does not
prevent the recovery of the same by another person.
'§ 1032. Fines and forfeitures, not specially granted
or appropriated by law, must be paid into the treasury
of the stete; and whenever by the provisions of law,
any propeny, real or personal, is forfeited to the people
of this state, or to any officer for their use, an action
for the recovery of such property, alleging the grounds
of the forfeiture, may be brought by the proper officer,
in the supreme court.

It was no part of the original design of the Commissioners
to review the system of procedure in justices' courts; but
further reflection and observation, as their work advanced,
satisfied them that it was indispensable to the proper and har-
monious arrangement of the entire system. Many statutes
equally applicable to proceedings in that court as to those of
higher jurisdiction, are rendered useless in regard to the latter,
by the new system of procedure, and must be either repealed
so far as they apply to one tribunal,.and left to stand in thdr
relation to another, or justices' courts must be included in
the revision.

446 rn con: OF
The Commissioners are of opinion, that the records in jus-
tices' courts are of a character requiring preservation. Their
decisions are final, unless appealed from, in the same man-
ner as judgments in higher courts. Their dockets have long
been declared to be evidence, and ought to be secured by
provisions for their preservation as public records. They
therefore determined to classify these courts as courts of re-
cord, and in this view, are required by law to include them
in the code.
The business of this court is larger in the aggregate, and
more intimately connected with the ordinary transactions of
the people, than that of any other, and there is a manifest
propriety in providing for it the very best eystem of procedure
which can be devised. An uniformity through all the courts,
as far as practicable, not only secures stability in the admin-
istration of justice, but it gives to inferior courts the benelit
of the learning and construction which would be otherwise
confined mostly to the higher tribunals. The justice's court
is the school, in which many of our mast eminent lawyers
\ and judges have taken their first lessons ; lessons which have
oRen beneficially influenced the opinions and conduct of the
lawyer, the judge and the statesman, in his later and more
elevated sphere. \
§ 1063. Parties in justices' couns may prosecute or
defend in person or by attorney, and any person may
act as attorney, except that the constable by whom the
summons or jury process was served, cannot appear or
act on the trial in behalf of either party. He may
however act, in any other stage of the action, as agent
or attorney for a party, and the authority of a person to
act for another as attorney, may be oral or written, but
unless admitted by the adverse party must be proved
by the oath of the attorney or otherwise.

<3 1064. Actionsin justices' courts are commenced by
summons, or bythe voluntary appearance and plead-
ings of the parties without summons. In the latter
case, the action is deemed commenced, at the time of
appearance.
In analogy to proceedings in the supreme court and to
secure uniformity in all cases as far as practicable, it is
deemed best to make the summons the only process by which
actions can be commenced, and when an arrest of the
defendant or attachment of his property is proper, to require
an order of the justice for that purpose to be endorsed.
§ 1065. When a guardian is necessary, he must be
appointed by the justice as follows:
1. If the infant be plaintiff, the appointment must be
made before the summons is issued, upon the applica-
tion of the infant, if he be of the age of fourteen years
or upwards, if under age, upon the application of some
relative or friend. The consent in writing of the guar-
dian to be appointed, and to be responsible for costs, if
hefail in the action, must be first filed with the justice.
2. If the infant be defendant, the guardian must be
appointed at the time the summons is returned, or be-
fore the pleadings. It is the right of the infant to nom-
inate his own guardianyif the infant be over fourteen
years of age, and the proposed guardian be present, ahd
consent in writing to be appointed. Otherwise the jus-
tice may appoint any suitable person who gives such
consent.

§ 1066. The summonds must be addressed to the de-
fendant by name, or if his name be unknown, by de-
scription of him, and must summon him to appear
before the justice, at his oflicein a town or ward, and at
a time specified therein, to answer the complaint of the
plaintiff, for a cause of action therein described in gen-
eral terms, sufficient to apprise the defendant of the na-
ture of the claim against him, and must state the
amount for which the plaintiff will take judgment, if
the defendant fail to appear and answer. It must be
subscribed by the plaintiff or by the justice before
-whom it is returnable.
The principal changes in practice required is this descrip-
tion of the summons are :
1. Its address to the defendant instead of a constable:
2. The direction to state the amount for which judgment
will be claimed if the defendant fails to appear and answer.
This is analogous to the summons in the supreme court; and
subsequent provision is made by which the plaintiif will be
induced to state his claim no higher than he can establish it
by evidence ;
3. The permission to the plaintid' toissue his ovm summons
if he chooses to do so. The summons in the supreme court
is always issued by the party or his attorney. Provision is
made for regular return days of process issued by the party,
at which times the justice is required to be in attendance, and
the system of costs is also made applicable to this mode of
proceeding.
§ 1067. The time mentioned in the summons, for the
appearance of the defendant, and the time of service
must be as follows:
Digitized by GOO8 le
CIYIL noel-zouns. 449
1. Where the sumnions is accompanied by an order
to arrest the defendant, or to attach property under sec~
tions 1071 and 1076, it must be returnable immediately:
2. When the defendant is nota resident of the coun-
ty, or where the plaintiff is not a resident, and gives
the security required by section 1082, it must be re~
turnable not more than three days from its date, and
must be served at least two days before the time for
appearance:
3. In all other cases it must be returnable, not more
than twelve days from its date, and must be served at
least six days before the time for appearance.
§ 1068. The summons must be served bya constable
of the county, as follows:
1. If the action be against a corporation, by delivery
of a copy to the president, or other head of the corpo-
ration, or to the secretary, cashier, or managing agent
thereof; or when no such ofiicer resides in the county,
to a director resident therein:
2. If against a minor under the age of fourteen
years, by delivery of a copy to such minor, and also to
his father, mother, or guardian, or if there be noun
within the county, then to any person having the cam
or control of such minor, or with whom he resides, or
'm whose service he is:

tee and to the defendant personally:
4. If an order to attach property be endorsed on the
iurnnions, by' leéving a copy, as prescribed in sectiori
1079.
5. In all other cases by delivery of a copy to the del
fendant personally.
By this section,the manner of service of thesummons isde-
i fined, vvhere d corpomtidn or a'minor, an insane person or ah
habitual drunkard is a defendant. The law has heretofore been
defective in this respect. The service by copy at the defend-
ant's residence is omitted. The summons, when served in that
manner was formerly followed by a warrant to arrest the
defendant; but that mode having'been superseded by the act
to abolish imprisonment for debt, and a new summons required
to be served personally before judgment can be taken, this
diode of service by copy is nb longer necessary.
§ 1069. When the action is on a promissory nofé,
`bHl of exchange, or other obligation for the payment of
money only, or for a specified amount of property, at a
valuation fixed in the contract, or on an account, the
plaintilf may serve, with the summons, a copy of his
-complaint, together with a copy of such obligation or
uccwnt. In such ease, unless the defendant, in his
answer, specifically deny the note, bill of exchange, or
other obligation or account, he is tobe deemed to have
admitted it.
This section is iri conformity with' the practice introduceli
by the code in higher courts, where its efects have been

crvm Pnoclount. 451.
very satisfactory. It saves the trouble of proof in those ca-
ses, where the demand has been presented to the defendant,
and he sees tit not to appear and deny it. In all other eases the
demand must be proved, whether the defendant fail to appear
or not,f unless he pu's ln an answer, and in that does not deny
the allegations in the complaint.
6 1o70. The parties are entitled to one hour in which#
tb appear; after the time mentioned in the summmis
for appearance, but are not bound to remain longer thnh;

§ 1071. Ari order to arrest the defendanf may be en-

fendant may be arrested thereon, by the constable, an
the time of serving the summons, and brougbt before

the following cases: l
1. In an action fbr the recovery of damages, on a
cause of action not arising on contract, when the cie-
fendant is not a resident of the county, or is abouttp,
remove therefrom, or when the action is for a wilful in-
jury to person, or to property knowing it to belong to
another:

cer of a corporation, or an attorney, factor, broker,
agent or clerk, in the course of his employment as such
orby any other person in a fiduciary capacity, or for
misconduct or neglect in office, or in a professional em-
ployrnentz
4. When the defendant has bevn guilty of a fraud in
contracting the debt, or incurring the obligation, for
which the action is brought, or in concealing or dispos-
ing of the property for the taking, detention or conver-
sion of which the action is brought:
.5. When the defendant has removed, concealed or
disposed of his property, or is about to do so, with in-
tent to defraud his creditors:
6. When an arrest is authorized by special statute,
in an action for a fine or penalty, or for a wilful viola-
tion of duty.
But no female can be arrested, except for a wilful
injury to person or to property knowing it to belong to
another.
An order to arrest a defendant is substituted for a warrant,
l in analogy to the practice in \he higher courts. The order to
arrest is properly a judicial act, to be granted only in certain
cases, and upon compliance with certain conditions, whereas a
process to commence an action is matter of right, and does
not depend on judicial discretion . The party has a right to his
summons or process to commem e the action,but not to arrest
a defendant, unless his case, when presented to an officer, is
Digitized by GOO8 le
czvu. rancznuns. 463
adjudged to one entitling him to that remedy. The process
is his own act, the order to arrest that of the court.
The cases in which an order for arrest may be made are de-
fined. They are those contained in the act to abolish impris-
onment for debt, modihed so as to conform to the provisions
of the code, and to those cases in which an arrest is allowed
in actions in the supreme court. They embrace the cases
also in which an order to attach property may be granted.
§1072. Before an order for an arrest can be made,
the party applying must prove, to the satisfaction of
the justice, by the affidavit of himself; or some other
person, the facts on which the application is founded,
and the amount of his debt or claim over all payments
and set-offs. The plaintiff must also execute and de-
liver to the justice a written undertaking, with or with-
out sureties, to the efiirct that if the defendant recover
judgment the plaintiff will pay to him all costs that
may be awarded to the defendant, and all damages
which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, not ex-
ceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which
must be double the amount claimed, not exceeding
one hundred dollars. If the undertaking be executed
by the plaintiff without sureties, he must annex there-
to an afiidavit, that hc is a resident and householderor
freeholder, within the county, and worth double the
sum specified in the undertaking, over all his debts and
liabilities.
That part of this section which requires the plain-
tif to give security, is new in its appiication to jus-
tices' courts. It~ is in conformity with the existing- law in
relation to arrests in the higher cuurts, in which no man can
Digitized by GOO8 le
'cu ms oonnor
be arrested by an order of a judge even, without first giving
security to pay costa and damages in case the alleged cause
of arrest should turn out to be unfounded. Since the justices'
act. as contained in the revised statutes was passed,the policy
of the law has been materially changed by abolishing impris-
onment for debt; but the law regulating proceedings in this
court has never been revised to make it conformable to the
spirit of that act. .In order to have an attachment against the
property of n defendant, stronger proofs were required than
to procure .a .warrant byxvhioh the defendant-was restrained
of his liberty, besides the securities that are required to be
givento the defendant 'for the payment of damages ln case
the plaintiff shall fail .w make out 'bis case. Abuses by the
arrest of thc defendant without good cause, are of common
occurrence, and it is deemed right to throw about the per-
sonal liberty of the party safeguards equal to those by which
the possession of property is protected.
§ 1073. The defendant, immediately upon being ar-
rested, must be taken to the ollice of the justice who
made the order, and if 'he be absent, or unable to try
the action, or if it be made to appear to him, by the
aflidavit of the defendant that he is a material witness
in the action, the constable must immedixtely take the
defendant before the next jnstice of the city or town,
who must take cognizance of the action, and proceed
thereon, as if the summons had been issued, and the
ofder of arrest made by him.
4 1074. The constable, making thearrest, must im-
mediately give notice thereof to the plaintiff; and en-
dorse on the summons and subscribe a certificate, sta-
ting the time of serving the same, the time of`¢the arrest,
and of his giving notice to the plaintifil
Digitized by GOO8 le

§ 1075. The constable .making an .arrest, or another
constable, by direction of the justice, must keep the
defendant in custody until duly discharged by order of
,the court, but in np case, can ~uch detention exceed
twelve hours from the time of his being first brought
before the justice, unless, within thattirne, .the trial
of the action be commenced, or unless i,t.be delayedat
the .request .of »thc.defendg.nt.
§ 1076. When the cause of action arises upon a judg-
ment rendered within this state, or an order of a court
,of competent jurisdiction, to pay,a sum pf money, or
.upon any other contract, an order to attach the property
.of the defendant, may be endorsed upon,a.surnmqn.s.,ip|-
,sued by the justice, in the following cases:
1. When the defendant has deported, or is about to
depart, from the county of his residence, or where the
,action is brought, with intent to defgnud ,his creditors,
or to avoid .the .service of grocess, or when .he keep
himself' concealed therein with the like intent:
2. When the defendant has concealed, removed or
disposed of his property, or is about to doso, with in-
tent to defraud his creditors.
1077. Before an .order to attach property can» be
.made, the .plaintiff must prove to the satisfaction of the
justice, by the afiidavit of himself; or .another person
the facts on which the application is founded; he must
,also provein the same manner, .the amount, as neariu
Digitized by GOO8 le 4
456 THE cons or
may be, of his debt or claim, over all payments and set-
offs. He must also execute, and deliver to the justice,
a written undertaking approved by him, with sufficient
lureties, to the effect that he will pay to the defendant,
all damages which he may sustain by reason of the
attachment, if the plaintiff fail to recover judgment;
and that ifjudgment be recovered, the plaintiff will re~
store so much of the property, or the avails thereof, if
any, as may remain after satisfying the judgment and
the subsequent costs.
§ 1078. The order of attachment, must state the
amount shown by the aflidavit to be due, and must di-
rect that the property of the defendant liable to execu-
tion, sudicient to satisfy the same, be attached and
kept, in order to satisfy any judgment that may be re-
covered in the action.
§ 1079. The constable, to whom the summons with
'the order is delivered, musttake into his possession,
the property of the defendant liable to execution in the
action, and keep the same as directed in the order, and
make an inventory thereo£ and deliver the same to the
defendant, if he can be found in the county. If not
found, the constable must leave a cop.r of the sum-
-mons, the order and the inventory certified by him, at
.the residence of the defendant, with some person of
,suitable age and discretion, if any such person be found
there, otherwise, he must post the same on the outer
.door of such residence. If the defendant have no place
Digitized by GOO8 le
cxvn. PROCEDURE. 457
of residence in the county, then the constable must
leave the copy with the person, in whose possession the
property is found.
By the act to abolish imprisonmer.t for debt, nn attachment
may be issued in some cases, when the defendant is neither
absent from the county nor concealed; but no provision is
made for serving the process by which the action is com-
menced personally on the defendant. In such cases it might
happen that the df-fendant's property attached is so situated
that he would get no notice of the proceedings, and have no
opportunity of defending on its rctum. This defect is reme-
died in this section.
§ 1080. The property, attached by a constable, must
not be removed by him, if an undertaking with sufii-
cient surety, be executed and delivered to him, to the
effect, that ifjudgment be rendered against the defend-
ant in the action and execution issued thereon, within
thirty days after the judgment, the property shall be
produced to satisfy the execution. If any person claim
the property attached, the same must be delivered tp
him, if at any time, after the seizure, and before a sale
on the execution, upon his executing, and delivering to
the constable, in whose custody the property may be,
an undertaking, with sufficient surety, to the effect,
that if any action be brought thereon within three
months, he will establish that he was the owner of the
property, at the time of the seizure, or pay the value
thereof to the plaintiff
§ 1081. The constable serving a summons must en-
dorse thereon a certificate of the time and manner of
Digitized by GOO8 le

per-vice. Ifproperty has been attached, that must he
parted in the return, and an inventory of the property
annexed. If an undertaking have been given, it mug
be returned to the justice, with the summons, and '
mentioned in the return.
§ 1082..A plaintiff who resides out of the state, he-
fore commencing his action, must file or deposit with
the justice security approved by him, for the payment
to the defendant of any judgment that may be reco-
vered by him in the action.
§ 1083. When property is attached and delivered to
a claimant upon an undertaking as provided in section
1080, if the value of the property recovered from him
upon the undertaking, exceed the judgment recovered
in the action, on which the property was attached, with
interest thereon, the defendant in such original action
is entitled to the excess. Or if such defendant satisfy
the claim and costs, or the judgment against him, .he
shall be entitled to the benefit of the undertaking of
the claimant, and may bring an action thereon in his
own name.

§ 1086. The pleadings may be oral, except when the
title to real property is brought in question, or they may
be in writing; if oral, the substance of them must be
entered by the justice in his docket; if in writing, they
must be filed in his office, and a reference to them
made in the docket. They are not required to be in any
particular form, but must be such, as to enable a per-
son of common understanding to know what is in-
tended.
§ 1087. The complaint must state in a plain and di-
rect manner, the facts constituting the cause of' action.
§ 1088. The answer may contain a denial of any of
the material facts stated in the complaint, which the
defendant believes to be untrue, and also a statement,
in a plain and direct manner, of any other facts, con-
stituting a defence, or a counter-claim upon which an
action might bc brought by the defendant against the
plaintiff in a justice's court.
§ 1089. When the answer contains a counter-claim,
the plaintiff may reply, denying any of the material
allegations relating thereto.

party has not suflicient knowledge or information in
respect to a particular allegation in the previous plead-

to a denial.
w 1091. When the cause of action or counter-claim
arises upon an account or instrument for the payment
of money only, it is sufficient for the party to deliver
the account or instrument to the court, and to state,
that there is due to him thereon, from the adverse par-
ty, a specified sum, which he claims to recover or set
081 The court may at the time of the pleading, require
that such Writing or account be exhibited to the inspec-

or if not so exhibited, may prohibit its being afterwards
given in evidence.
§ 1092. Every complaint, answer, or reply, must be
verified by the oath of the party pleading, or if he be
not present, by the oath of his agent or attorney, to the
effect that he believes it to be true. The verification
must be oral or in writing, in conformity with the plead-
ing verified.
§ 1093. Every material allegation in a complaint, or
relating to a counter-claim in an answer, not denied by
the pleading of the adverse party, must, on the trial be
taken to be true, except, that when a defendant, who
has not been served with a copy of the complaint with
the summons, fails to appear and answer, the plaintiff;
cannot recover, without proving his case.

the court, not exceeding three dollars; but such pay-

and undertaking, the justice must enter an order in

that court, in all respects as if the action nad been

The plaintiff may, however, by a notice served within
twenty days thereafter, decline to prosecute his action
in the supreme court; in such case, the claim shall be
deemed abandoned, and no costs shall be recovered
against him in the supreme court.
§ 1100. The defendant is not at liberty to give evidence,
by which the question of title to real property is raised
on the trial before a justice. And when from the.plain-
tiff's own showing, on the trial, it appears that the de-
termination of the action will necessarily involve the
decision of a question of title to real property, the jus-
tice must dismiss the action, with costs, stating on his
docket the reason therefor; bnt such dissmissal sha'l
not preclude the plainiff from an action in the supreme
court for the same cause.
§ 1101. When the title to real property is set forth in
the answer as provided in section 1097, or appears on
the trial as provided in the last section, and there are
other causes of action in the complaint, not affected by
the question of title, the order to transfer or to dismiss
the action, shall not include such other causes; but as
to them, the action must be severed, and tried before
the justice in the same manner, as il' the question of
title had not been raised.
§ 1102. Upon the return day, if a jury be required, or
if the justice be actually engaged in other oH'icial busi-

ness, he may adjourn the trial without the consent of
either party, as follows:
1. Where a party, who is not n resident of the coun-
ty, is in attendance; or where the defendant is in at-
tendance under arrest; the adjournment not to exceed
twenty-four hours ; and the defendant, if under arrest,
to continue in custody:
2. In other cases, not to exceed five days, unless by
consent of parties.
If the trial be not adjourned, it must take place im- \
mediately upon the return of the summons.
§ 1103. The trial may be adjourned by consent, or up-
on application of either party, without the consent of
the other, for a period not exceeding eight days, as fol-
lows:
1. The party asking the adjournment must, if requir-
ed by his adversary, prove by his own oath or other-
wise, that he cannot, for want of material testimony,
which he expects to procure, safely proceed to trial:
2. If the application be on the part of the plaintifi]
and the defendant be under arrest, an adjournment for
more than twenty-four hours, discharges the defendant
from custody, but the action may proceed notwith-
standing: and the defendant shall be subject to arrest
on the execution in the same manner as if he had not
been so discharged:

3. If the application be on the part of a defendant
under arrest, before it can be granted, he must execute
an undertaking, with one or more sufiicient sureties to
be approved by the justice, as follows: If the arrest be
:for a cause specifiedin the first four subdivisions of sec-
tion 1071, or in the sixth, the undertaking must be to the
effect, that he will appear at the return day, and not de-
part from the court until duly discharged, or until after
the trial and judgment,and after a reasonable opportunity
to arrest him on execution issued upon the judgment, if
any be obtained against him. Ifthe arrest be for a cause
specified in subdivision 6,ofthat section, the undertaking
must be to the effect, that no part of the property of the
defendant, liable to be taxen on execution, shall be
removed, secreted, assigned, or otherwise disposed 012
except for the necessary support, for the time, of him-
self and family, until the p1aintiH"s demand be satis-
fied, or until the expiration of ten days after the judg-
ment, if any be obtained against him in the action:
4. Either party applying for an adjournment, must
also, if required by the adverse party, consent that the
tesdmony of any witnesses of such adverse party who
are in attendance, be then taken by deposition before the
justice, which must accordingly be done; and the tes-
timony so taken may be read on the trial with the same
effect, and subject to the same objections, as if the Wit-
ness were produced.
The various provisions for adjournment in the justice's act
are embodied in this section and the two following, with some
Digitized by GOO8 le
cruz. nocmnnnt. 467
momiincation. Uhder the existing law, an adjournment upon
joining the issue, is I matter of course ; this section requires
that cause for an adjournment should be shdwn, when moved
for, by a party at any time, and imposes the further condition,
that any witness on time ailverse side may be sworn and ex-
amined and dnt his nieposition my afterwards be 'nad oh the
trial.
§ 1104. Aa adjournment may be had, either at the
time of joining the issue, or at any subsequent time w
which the cause may stand adjourned, an application
of either party, for a period longer than eight days, but
not to exceed ninety days from the time of the return
-of the summons, upon compliance with the provisions
of the last section, and upon proof; by the oath of the
party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the just e, that
such party cannot be ready for trial before the time to
which he desires an adjournment, for the want of ma-
terial evidence, describing it, that the delay has not
been made necessary by any act or negligence on his
part, since the action was commenced, and that he ex-
pects to procure the evidence at the time stated by him.
§ 1105. If the plaintiff fail to appear at the return day
-of the summons and make his complaint, the action
must be dismissed, If the defendant fail to appear at
the return day of the summons, or if either party fail,
to attend at a day to which the trial has been adjourn-
ed, or fail to make the necessary pleading or proof on
his part, the case may nevertheless proceed at the re-
quest of the adverse party; and judgment must be giv-
en in conformity with the pleadings and proofs.

468 THE con: or
§1106. A trial by jury must be demanded at the
time of joining issue; and is waived, if neither party
then demand it. When demanded, the trial of the
case must be adjourned, until a time and place fixed
for the return of the jury. If neither party desire an
adjournment, the time and place must be determined
by the justice, and must be on the same day or within
the next two days. The jury must be immediately
drawn and summoned, and the return thereof made as
prescribed in sections 317, 318, and 319.
Important changes are made in relation to a jury trial in
justices' courts :
1. The demand ol a jury trial must be made at the time
ue is joined :
2. The jury fees are increased to twenty-tive cents each,
for all who are summoned and attend, whether sworn or not,
and must be deposited with the justice at the time a jury is
demanded :
3. The jury is drawn from a jury-box, and summoned as
in the higher courts, and not left to be chosen by a constable,
as heretofore, often to the great scandal of the institution.
4. If, upon the attendance of a jury, the cause is adjourned,
the jury fees for attendance must be paid by the party moving
the adjournment, and they must again attend at the time to
which the trial is adjourned.
These provisions, it is believed,wil1 prove salutary in se-
curing goal juries, and in preveutingthe unnecessary ca1l of
juries in trifling. cases. Provision is also made for determining
the competency of a juror ; and the causes oi`challenge,which
are defined in the Code, apply to justices' courts as wellas
others.
§ 1107. At the time appointed for the trial, and on
the return of the order, if the trial be not fwher ad_
Digitized by GOO8 le
emi. mmclznuit. 38
journed, and if adjourned, then at the time To which
the trial is adjourned, the justice must proceed to draw
from the jurors summoned, the names of persons to
consiitute The jury for the trial of the issue. Six jurors
constitute a jury, but by consent of parties, a iess num-
ber may act.
§ 1108. If a suitlicient number of competent and in-
miifferent jurors do not attend, the justice must direct
others to be summoned by a constable, from the vicini-
ty, sufiicient to complete the jury.
§ 1109. The ballots containing names .of jurors not
summoned, if any, and of those summoned, but not
drawn, must bereturned by the justice to the drawn ju-
ry box, except that such of them as contain the names
of persons, not liable to serve as jurors, must be destroy-
ed. The ballots containing the names of the jurors,
who serve, must not be returned to the same box from
which they were taken, until all the names have been
drawn out. As often as that happens, the whole num-
ber must be returned to the undrawn jury box, to be
drawn as in the first instance.
§1110. Before a party can be entitled 'to a jury, he
must deposit with the justice the sum of three dollars,
for jury fees, from which the justice must refund to the
party the fees of all jurors Who do not attend, and those
not refunded must be included in the judgment as part
of the costs, in case the party calling the jury recover
judgment.

§ 1111. No adjournment can be granted after the ne-
turn of the jury, unless the party requiring the same, in
addition to the other conditions imposed on him, depos-
in with the justice, to be immediately paid to the jurors
attending, the sum of twenty-five cents each, which
amount is in no case to be included as part of the costs
in the judgment. After the adjournment the jurors
must attend at the time and place appointed, without
further notice, and the fees deposited when the jury was
demanded, with the justice, may remain in his hands
until the jury are impanelled, and must be then paid
over to them~
§ 1112. If either pany object to the competencfof

cause only of reversal on appeal, and does not other-
wise invalidate the judgment, if not taken, at the trial,
it is waived, and is no cause of reversal.
By this section, the cases are defined where the action may
be dismissed. The plaintiH` cannot be non-suited nor can the
action be dismissed without his own consent. If he insist on
having his case decided finally in the action, it is his right to
do so. If he Ends his proof defective, or for any other cause
chooses to dismiss his own action before it is finally submit-
ted, he reserves his right of action; but if he submits it to
either court or jury, it is at his peril, and conclusive.
1115. When the defendant fails to appear and an-
swer, judgment must be given for the plaintiii] as fol-
lows:
1. Where a copy of the complaint and account, or
instrument, has been served personally with the sum-
mons, as prescribed in section 1069, judgment must be
given without further evidence for the sum specified in
the summons:
2. In other cases the justice must hear the evidence
of the plaintiff; and render judgment for such sum only
as shall appear by the evidence to be just; but in no
case to exceed the amount specified in the summons,
§ll16. Upon issue joined, if a jury trial 'be not de-
manded, 1he justice must hear the evidence, and decide
all questions of fact andof law, and render judgment
accordingly.
1 § 1117. Upon a_verdict, the justice must immediately
rgnder judgment accordingly. When the trial is by

the justice, judgment must be entered immediately
after the close of the trial, if the defendant has been
arrested, or his property attached: in other cases, it
must be entered either at the close of the trial, or, if
the justice then desire further time to consider, on the
fourth day thereafter, both days inclusive.
§ 1118. When the amount found due to either party
exceeds the sum, for which the justice is authorized to
enter judgment, such party may remit the excess, and
judgment may be entered for the residue.
§ 1119. In an action arising on contract, when there
is no counter-claim, if the plaintiff fail to recover
judgment for an amount equal to that stated in his
summons, he cannot recover costs.
This section is introduced to prevent plaintiffs from setting
up claims for a larger amount than is really due where a cause
of action exists. It sometimes happens that a plaintiff (wish-
ing to try a doubtful claim at the expense of his adversary,)
buys a small note, commences an action, and litigates his
other claim, in the consciousness that the costs must at all
events fall upon the defendant. This section also affords
security to a defendant who is sued for a debt which he is not
disposed to controvert. He is enabled to know, from the copy
of summons in his possession, the extent of the judgment
that can be taken against him. Instances of fraud upon a
defendant have occurred under the present system, where the
summons in all cases lays the plaintiE"s damage at fifty dollars
or under, as expressed in the printed blank forms. When
the defendant failed to appear, the plaintiff, instead of declar-
ing on the debt, which the defendant expected, has taken ad-
vantage of his absence, and produced perhaps some purchased
note, barred by the statute of limita tions, or to which the de-
fendant had some other good defence.

§ 1120. If the defendant, at any timebefare the trini,
offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken against
him for a specified sum, the plaintiff may irnmediatdy
have judgment therefor, with the costs then accrued.
But if he do not accept such offer before the trial, and
fail to recover in the action a sum equal to the o&`er,
he cannot recover costs accrued after the offer: but
costs must be adjudged against him, and if he recover,
deducted from his recovery. But the offer, and failure
to accept it, cannot be given in evidence, to affect the
recovery, otherwise than as to costs, as above provided.
This section introduces a practice analogous to that under
the Code in the supreme court, and is calculated to prevent
unreasonable claims being set up, and to induce fair oiers and
liberal compromises. Of its usefd efeeuthe Commilimd!
entertain no doubt.
§ 1121. When a judgment is rendered, in a case
where the defendant is subject to arrest and imprison-
ment thereon, it must be so stated in the judgment, and
entered in his docket.
§ 1122. The justice, on the demand of a party in
whose favor judgment is rendered, must give him a
transcript thereof; which may be filed and docketed in
the office of the clerk of the county where the judgment
was rendered. The time of the receipt of the trans-
cript by the county clerk, must be noted by him there-
on, and entered in the docket; and from that time, the
judgment creates a lien in the same manner, as a judg-
Digitized by GOO8 le
czvu Pawmwu. m
ment of the supreme court. Upon a transcript of such
docket, certified by the clerk of the county, and filed in
any other county, the judgment may be there docketed
with the same effect, from the time of filing and dock-
sting in that county. The judgment so docketed, and
the enforcement thereof; are subject to the control d
the county court of the county where it was first dock-
eted, as a judgment of that court. But a judgment for
less than twenty-five dollars, so docketed, is not a lien
upon, and cannot be enforced against real property.
§ 1128. Execution for the enforcement of a judgment
in a justice's court, except when it has been docketed
in the county clerk's office, may be issued by the justice
before whom the judgment was rendered, or by his suc-
cessor in ofiice, on the application of the party entitled
thereto, at any time within five years from the entry of
judgment. '
Theexisiing law changed so as to allow execution to be
issued immediately after judgment, according to the pmotiee
in the higher courts. When a debt is justly due and has been
no adjudged by a court, it seems a perversion of right still to
extend the time for its collection. The delay is less neccssaf
ry since the exemption of property has been extended.
§ 1124. The executian must be directed to a eonsta
ble ofthe county, and subscribed by the justice by whom
the judgment was rendered, or by his successor in ofl
fice, and must bear date the day of its delivery to the
Digitized by GOO8 le

oflicer to be executed. It must intelligibly refer to the
judgment, by stating the names of the parties, and the
name of the justice before whom, and of the county
and town where, and the time when, it was rendered;
the amount of the judgment; and, if less than the
whole is due, the true amount due thereon. It must
require the constable substantially as follows:
I. If it be a case where the defendant cannot be ar-
restsd, it must direct the ofiicer to collect the amount
of the judgment out of the personal property of the
debtor, and to paygthe same to the party entitled
thereto:
2. If it be a case where the defendant may be ar-
rested, in addition to the foregoing, it must direct the
otlicer, if sufficient property of the defendant liable to
the execution cannot be found to satisfy the judgment,
that he arrest the debtor, and commit him to the jail
of the county, until he pay the judgment, or be dis-
charged according to law:
3. It must further, in all cases, direct the ofiicer to
make return of the execution, and a certificate thereon,
showing the manner in which he has executed the
same, in sixty days from the time of his receipt thereo£
§ 1125. Upon an execution on a judgment against
joint debtors, upon one or more of whom the summons
was not served, the execution must contain a direction
to collect the amount out of the joint property of all tlze
Digitized by GOO8 le
cxvu. mocxnvnn. 477
defendants, or the separate property of the persons up-
on whom the summons was served, to be specified by
name. If such judgment be also such that the dg;
fendants are subject to arrest thereon, the justice must
further specify the names of' those defendants, served
with the summons, who may be arrested for Want of
property.
§ 1126. A constable may, at his peril, omit to arrest
a debtor; or after arrest, suffer him to go at large be-
fore the return day ; subject only to his liability for an
escape, or for omitting to arrest, if he fail to have either
the money or the person of the debtor in custody at the
expiration of the sixty days.
§ 1127. When an execution directs the arrest of the
debtor for want of sutlicient personal chattels, if there
be not sufficient subject to levy known to the officer, or
if upon demand by the officer of the debtor, he fail to
produce sufiicient property, the otlicer may without fur-
ther delay arrest the defendant. When arrested, the
defendant must be conveyed to the common jail of the
county, and there be kept in custody until the execu-
tion with costs be paid, or he be discharged by due
course of law.
/
§ 1128. The debtor committed as provided in the last
section, may be held in prison ten days: and if he be
a person without a family, for which he provides, one
day in addition, for every dollar over ten due on the
Digitized by GOO8 le .4
m 'HIE consul'
execution; or, if he have a family for which he pro-
vides, one day in addition, fbr every two dollars over
twenty due on the execution.
§1129. The aflidavit of an imprisoned debtor, that
he has a family for which he provides, specifying by
name one or more persons, members of such family,
and the place of their residence, is sufficient evidence
thereof; to authorise his discharge by the jailor.
The last four sections contain some new provisions, calcu-
lated to soften the harshness of judicial arrests,when allowed,
and yet to secure all the benefits to be expected from them.
§ l 130. An execution may, at the request of the plain-
tiff] be renewed before the expiration of sixty days from
the time of its issue, by the word " renewed" written
thereon, with the date thereof; and subscribed by the
justice. Such renewal has the effect of an original
issue ; and may be repeated as often as may be neces-
sary. If an execution be returned unsatisfied, another
may be afterwards issued.
§ 1131. A debtor cannot be arrested, nor his property
sold on execution, after sixty days from its issue or re-
newel; but property levied on within the sixty days,
may be sold after a renewal.
§1132. A constable is liable to the party in whose
favor an execution is issued to him, for the amount
thereof; in the following cases:

to him or to the party entitled, the money collected
thereon by him:
2. When he wilfully or carelessly omits to levy upon
property; or if the debtor be liable 'to arrest, to arrest
and imprison him, within sixty days; or having arrest-
ed the debtor, fails to commit him to the county jail,
within the sixty days.
§ 1133. Upon a justice's judgment docketed in a
county clerk's office, execution can only be issued by
thc clerk with whom the transcript is filed, or by the
plaintiff in person: and it may be sent to one or more
counties where the judgment is docketed. It must
conform substantially to the execution issued by a jus-
tice, except that it must state the time when the judg-
ment was docketed in the county from which it is is-
sued, and must be directed to the sheriff; and may di-
rect, that for want of suflicient personal property, the
debt be made out of the real propeny of the debtor.
Until the adoption of the code in 1848, the county clerk
alone could issue executions in these cases. The practice
since then of issuing them by the pany doe~ not seem well
adapted to this class of judgments, when the parties generally
act in person, and are not conversant with the forms of pro
cess.

§ 1184. Justices' courts being couns of peculiar and

which are in their nature applicable to the organization,
powers and course of proceeding in justices' courts,
Digitized by GOO8 le
crvm nocmun. 481
and in respect to which no special provision is made
in this chapter, are applicable to justices' courts and
the proceedings therein.
With a view to promote as far as practicable, a uniform
course of proceeding in all courts, it has been deemed best to
make the provisions of the code generally applicable to jus-
tices' courts as far as the nature of the case and their peculiar
jurisdiction and organizations admit. This chapter contains
all that is peculiar to the court, and a few rules that are com-
mon to all ; but these for the most part are contained in ,
other parts of the code.
§ 1136. Every justice must keep a book, denominat-
ed a docket, in which must be entered by him,
1. The title of every action in which the summons
is returned served, or when the parties voluntarily ap-
pear:
2. The date of the summons, and the time of its re-
turn ; and if an order to arrest the defendant or attach
property was made, such fact must also be stated:
3. The time when the parties, or either of them, ap-
peared; a minuteof the pleadings ; if in writing, re-
ferring to them; if not in writing, a concise statement
of the material parts of the pleadings:
4. Every adjournment; stating on whose application,
whether on oath, evidence, or consent, and to what time:
5. When a trial by jury is demanded, the demand
must be stated, and by whom made, the names of the
[c1vu. oonn] 31
Digitized by GOO8 le
482 ras cons or
jury drawn, and the time appointed for the trial and re-
turn of the jury:
6. The names of the jury who appear, and of those
sworn; the names of all witnesses sworn, and at whose
request; the objection, if any, made to testimony, and
the decision thereon:
7. The verdict of the jury, and when received; if the
jury disagree, and are discharged, that fact must be
stated:
8. The judgment of the court; specifying the items
of costs included,'and the time when rendered:
9. The issuing of execution ; when issued, and to
whom; the renewals thereof; if any, and when made;
the return, and when made; and a statement of any
money paid to the justice, and when, and by whom:
10. The giving of a transcript to be filed in the
county clerk's ofiice, and when given:
11. The receipt of a notice of appeal, or order to
make or amend a return, stating the time of the re-
ceipt, and the fees therefor.
§ 1136. The several particulars in the last sec-
tionspecified, must be entered under the title of the
action to which they relate, and at the time when they
occur. Such entries in a justice's docket, or a trans-
cript thereof; certified by the justice, or his successor
Digitized by GOO8 le
cxvn. vnocnnuaz. 483
in oflice, are primary evidence to prove the facts so
stated therein.
' § 1137. A justice must keep an alphabetical index to
his docket, in which must be entered the names of the
parties to each judgment, with a reference to the page
of the entry. The names of the plaintiffs must be en.-
tered in the index, in the alphabetical order of the first
letter of the family names.
§ 1188. It is the duty of every justice, upon the ex-7
piration of his term of otiice, to deposit with his suc-
cessor his ofHciaI dockets, as well his own as those df
his predecessor, which may be in his custody ; there
to be kept as public records. If the oflice of a justice
become vacant, by his death, or removal from the
town or otherwise, before his successor is elected and
qualified, the dockets, in possession of such justice,
must be deposited with the supervisor of the town, to
be by him delivered to the successor in ofHce of the
justice.
§1139. Any justice, with whom the docket of his
predecessor is deposited, may issue execution on a
judgment there entered and unsatisfied, and not dock-
eted in the county clerk's office, in the same manner
and with the same effect, as the justice, by whom the
judgment was rendered, might have done.
§ 1140. The justice elected to fill a vacancy, or when
elected, chosen by lot to fill a vacancy for less than 4
6111 term, is deemed the successor of the justice whope
Digitized by GOO816
484 ms coma or
omce became vacant before the expiration of a full term.
When a full term expires, the same or anothor person
elected to take oiiice in the same town, from that time
is deemed the successor.
§ 1141. When two or more justices are equally enti-
tled, under the last section, to be deemed the succes-
sors in ofiice of a justice, the supervisor of the town
must by a certificate subscribed by him, and filed in
the office of the town clerk, with a duplicate attached
10 the last docket, designate which justice is to be
deemed the successor of a justice going out of ofhce
or whose 0mce has become vacant.
The provisions of the last five sections are new, but it is be
lieved that their propriety will be at once generally concurred
in. A justice's docket, containing the records of many hun}
dred judgments, and perhaps proof, of their satisfaction, ought
surely to be provided by law with a place of deposit, where
it may be found.
§1142. The summons, execution, and every other
paper made or issued by a justice, must be filled up
without a blank lefi to be filled by another ; otherwise
it is void.
§ 1143. Every justice now in office and every justice
hereafter elected, before entering upon the duties of his
ofiice, must, by appointment in writing, filed with the
town clerk, assign a day of the week, and a place
at which, a summons, issued by a plaintiff himself, may
be made returnable before him. It is the duty of the jus-
tice to attend at his oilice, thus designated, on the day
Digitized by GOO8 le
clvn. Pnocsnunn. 485
assigned for returns, from nine o'clock in the morning
until four o'clock in the afternoon.
§ 1144. The day so appointed must not be the same,
specified in the appointment of another justice of the
same town previously tiled. The place so designated
may be known as the justice's office and may be after-
wards changed by him, on filing a new appointment,
and posting notices thereof in three public places of'
the town.
§ 1145. In case of the sickness, other disability, or
necessary absence of a justice, at the time appointed,
another justice of the same town may, at his request,
attendin his behalf; and shall thereupon become vest-
ed with the power, for the time being, of the justice
before whom the summons was returnable. In that
case the proper entry of the proceeding before the at-
tending justice, subscribed by him, must be madoin
the docket of the justice before whom the summons
was returnable. If the case be adjourned, the justice
before whom the summons was returnable, mustre-
sume jurisdiction.
The last four sections provide for a systematic arrange-
ment of the time at which a summons may be made retuma-
ble before a justice when issued by a party. The Commis-
sioners are satisfied that it will be found convenient and bene-
ticialboth to the justices themselves, and to those who .do
business in their courts. It is not designed to prevent a jus-
tice from issuing a summons returnable before himself on an-
other day if he sees fit.

§ 1146. A justice may at the request of a party, and
on being satistied that it is expedient, specially depute
any discreet person, of suitable age, and not interested
in the action, to serve a summons or execution, with
or without an order to arrest the defendant, or to attach
property. Such deputation must be in writing on the
process.
§1147. The person so deputed has the authority of a
constable in relation to the service, execution and return
of' such process, and is subject to the same obligations,
but cannot receive a fee for the service.
§ 1148. When the sureties of a constable make com-
plaint to.a county judge, that such constable has un-
lawfully converted to his own use, or misapplied,
money collected by him as constable, for which.they
have been sued, or are liable to be sued, such applica-
tioh being verified by oath that they believe it to be
true, the county judge must immediately make an or-
der, suspending~such constable from the further exer-
cise of his oflicial powers, until he give new security.
Such order must be served on the constable, and filed
in the oflice of the town clerk.
§ 1149. When an execution is delivered to a consta-
ble, within the last sixty days of his term of oflice, he
may, notwithstanding the expiration of his term, pro-
ceed thereon, in the same manner as if he still con-
tinued in otlice, and his sureties shall be liable to the
same extent.

§ 1150. A justice may punish, as for a criminal con-
tempt, persons guilty of the following acts, and no
others :
1. Disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behaviour
toward the justice while holding the court, tending to
interrupt the due course of a trial, or other judicial
proceeding:
2. A breach of the peace, boisterous conduct, or vio-
lent disturbance, tending to interrupt the due course of
a trial or other judicial proceeding:
3. Wilful resistance in the presence of the justice;
to the execution of a lawful order or process made or
issued by him.
§1151. A warrant of arrest may be issued »by such
justice, on which the person so guilty may be arrested,
and brought before the justice, on the same day, or the
next judicial day, when an opportunity to be heardin
his defence or excuse must be given. The justice may
thereupon discharge him, or may convict him of the
offence, and adjudge a punishment by fine or imprison-
ment,or both; such fine not to exced twenty dollars,
and such imprisonment, ten days.
§ 1152. The conviction, specifying particularly the
offence and the judgment thereon, must be entered by
the justice in his docket. A warrant of commitment

Such warrant must contain a transcript of the entry in
the docket; and the same must be executed by any
constable to whom it may be given, and by the jailer
of the county.
§ 1153. If a person summoned as a juror or witness
fail to attend, the justice may issue o warrant to arrest
the delinquent for the purpose of compelling his attend-
ance, and punishing his disobedience.
§ 1154. When the person arrested is brought before
the justice, or when a person in attendance refuses to
serve as a juror or to testify as a witness, and no valid
excuse be shown, the justice may impose a fine upon
him, not exceeding five dollars. An entry of such fine,
stating the reason thereof; must be made by the jusdce
in his docket, and thereupon shall have the effect of' a
judgment, in favor of the overseers of the poor of the
town against the delinquent, and may be enforced as
well against his person as his property.
§ 1155. The term "justice," as used in this chapter,
includes justice of the peace and justices of justices'
courts in cities; the term "town," includes ward or
district, in reference to justices' courts in cities ; and

when there is more than one defendant included in the

moning a jury, the constable must certify irrliis return
the number of miles actually and necessarily travelled
to make the service on all the persons served, and his
fees shall he accordingly; when a debtor is arrested on

plying therefor.

§ 1160. Upon an execution issued on a justice's judg-
ment docketed in a county clerk's oflice, the same fees
are allowed as on executions issued by a justice ; ex-
cept that when real property is sold, the printefs fees
for advertising may be charged in addition, and also,
the same fees for a certificate of sale, and for a sherifl"s
deed, as are allowed in the supreme court.
§ 1161. If a justice, constable, witness or juror re-
ceive greater fees than are allowed by law, the excess
may be recovered back, even though they may not be
included in the judgment. `
The changes made in the fees are considerable, and are ad-
justed like those in the higher courts by the result attaind,
and the state of the action rather than by the number of steps
taken to arrive at any particular stage. The items are
few in number, but respectable in the amount of compensa-
tion for the average services required. Whether they.are
too large or too small, the legislature can determine quite as
well or better than the Commissioners. But recollecting a
resolution of the assembly in 1848, in relation to filling the
blanks in sections regulating costs in the higher courts, the
Commissioners have deemed it their duty to specify sums
here, leaving it to the legislature to adopt or change them
as it may seem fit.

§1180. In an action arlsing on contract, notwith-
_standing an appeal and security given for a stay of pro-
ceedings thereon, if the respondent give adequate se-
curity to make restitution, in case the judgment is re-
versed or modified, he may, upon leave obtained from
the court below, proceed to enforce the judgment.
Such security must be an undertaking, executed to
the appellant, by at least two sufficient sureties, to
the effect, that if the judgment be reversed or modi-
fied, the respondent will make such restitution as the
appellate court may direct.
The object of this section is to secure to a party, who has
obtained a judgment, the benefit of it, notwithstanding an
appeal, if he will give adequate security to make restitution,
in case the judgment is reversed. This appears to be reason-
able, inasmuch as the recovery of the judgment creates a
strong presumption, that the amount of it is due to the credi-
tor. If parties are equally willing to give security to abide
by the judgment of an appellate court, he, whose right to the
subject of the litigation has been aiiirmed by the decision of a
Digitized by GOO8 le
500 tm: cons or
competent court, has the better claim to the benelit of it, du-
ring the appeal. The adoption of the section will do much
to discourage unfounded appeals, which are now not unfre-
queutly brought for delay.
§ 1181. The undertakings prescribed by sections 1174,
1175, 1176 and 1178, may be in one instrument or sever-
.d, at the option of the appellant ; and a copy, including
the names and residence of the sureties, must be served
on the adverse party, with the notice of appeal, unless
a deposit is made as provided in section 1174 and notice
thereof given.
Amended Code, lg 340.
§ 1182. An undertaking upon an appeal is of no eil
fect, unless it be accompanied by the affidavit of the
sureties, that they are each worth. double the amount
specified therein. The adverse party may, however,
except to the sufficiency of the sureties, within ten
days after notice of the appeal; and unless they or other
sureties justify before a judge of the court below, or a
county judge,as prescribed by sections 691 and 692,with-
in ten days thereafter, the appeal must be regarded asif
no such undertaking had been given. The justification
-must be upon a notice of not less than five days.

of the city of New-York, an appeal, upon either the law
or the fact, may be taken to the general term, from a
judgment entered upon the refort of the referees or the
direction of a single judge of the same court. Security
must be given upon such appeal, in the same manner
as upon an appeal to the court of appeals. In the su-
preme court, the appeal must be heard in the same
manner as if it were an appeal from an inferior court ;
but the decision at the general term upon the facts se-
parately ' ri-om the law, is final.
.Hmmded Code, § 348.

Under the former practice, all questions, whether of fact or
law, in equity suits, were the subjects of appeal, even to the
court of last resort. The amendment made in 1849 bythe
legislature to section 348, confined an appeal to questions of
aw only, and in e8`ect made the decision of a dngle judge
on the first trial conclusive. There is a propriety in not sub-
jecting the verdict of a jury on the facts, to the review of a
court ; to allow which would much impair the value of a jury
trial. Not so, however, with respect to the decision of a dn-
gle judge, where a due regard to the rights of parties seems to
us to require, that at least one opportunity should be adbrded
to review such a decision more especially when we consider
that in the class of cases, where the trial of facts is by the
court, it is sometimes ditlicult to separate the law and fact.
To meet this view, we propose to modify the amendment of
last year as provided in this section.
§ 1189. An appeal may in like manner, and within
the same time, be taken from an order made by a sin-
gle judge of the same court, and may be thereupon re-
viewed in the following cases:
1. When the order grants or refuses a provisional
remedy:
2. When it grants or refuses a new trial:
13. When it involves the merits of the action, or some
part thereof '
4. When the order affects a substantial right, and
involves the construction of the constitution or of a
provision of this code:
5. When the order is made, upon a summary appli-
cation in an action after judgment, and affects a sub-
.stantial right.

New.
This section and the next two are intended to define the
extent of the jurisdiction which our courts may exercise.
This seems the more necessary to be done, since legal tictions
are abolished. It is a curious fact in legal history, that the
jurisdiction, as well as the practice of courts, has depended in
a considerable degree upon tictions. ln the case of Mostyn
vs. Fabrigas, Cowp. 161, it became a question, whether the
defendant was 'responsible in England for a false imprison-
ment in the island of Minorca, and Lord Mansfield,delivering
the judgment of the court, placed his reason principally upon
the venue being laid in England, that is, the plaintiff had
averred that the defendant imprisoned him at Mnwca, to wit,
at London qforesaid in the parish of St. .Mary le Bow in the
ward qfC/zeap. Upon such reasons, was the doctrine estab-
lished that trespasses abroad might be sued for in courts at
home.
The qualification, in section 1251, with respect to actions
concerning real property, is proper in itself, and conformable
to the decisions of our courts. Livingston vs. Jefferson, 1
Brockenb , 203 ~Watts vs. Kinney, 6 Hill 82.
§ 1250. No corporation is subject to the jurisdiction
of a court of this state, unless it appear in the court, or
have been created by, nr under the laws of this state,
or have an agency established therein for the transac-
tion of some portion of' its business, or have property
therein, and in the last case only to the extent of such
property at the time the jurisdiction attached.
New.
§ 1251. When the court has jurisdiction of the parties,
it may exercise it, in respect to any cause of action,
Digitized by GOO8 le
526 rm cont. or
wherever arising, except for the specific recovery of real
property, situated out of this state, or an injury thereto,
and except also as provided in section 988.
New.
§ 1252. When a cause of action has arisen in a sis-
ter state, or in a foreign country, and by the laws there-
of, an action thereon cannot there be maintained
against a person by reason of the lapse of time, an ac-
tion thereon cannot be maintained against him in this
state, except in favor of a citizen thereof; who has had
the cause of action from the time it accrued.
It is a general principle of our jurisprudence, that the law
of the place, where a contract is made, determines its vali-
dity and construction, but that the remedy is to be adminis-
tered according to the law of the place where the action is
brought. The prescription of actions, or the time within
which they may be brought, is, however, placed in the latter
category, 13 Peters,312,-6 Wend., 475. Hence,it hap-
pens, thata person who, by the lapse of time, is absolved
from prosecution in his own state, is held liable the moment
he passes it, even though the liability may be to his neighbor,
who followshim 'fora remedy which he has lost at home.
Now, as a general principle, it appears most consonant with
right, that where, by the law of the domicil of the debtor, the
debt is barred, it should be barred every where, except in fa-
vor of a domestic creditor.
Take, for example, the case of two persons living in the
same town in Georgia. They had transactions twenty years
ago, and one claimed a balance from the other, but time gra-
dually closed over the claim, without any attempt by the ore
ditor to enforce it in his own courts. At length, the debtor
takes a journey to this state, and the creditor follows him and
sues in our courts. The defendant cannot defend himself

upon our rule of limitations,because a person absent from the
state is excepted from its operation, and, thus, our courts are
compelled to investigate this ancient claim. It is to provide
for such a contingency, that this section is proposed.
§ 1253. The clerk must keep among the records of
the court, a register of actions. He must enter therein
the title of the action, with brief notes under it, from
time to time, of' all papers filed, and proceedings had,
therein.

procuring hereafter full and accurate statistics of litigation.
§ 1254. When there are three referees, all must meet,
but two of them may do any act which might be done
by all; and whenever any authority is conferred on
three or more persons, it may be exercised by a major-
ity, upon the meeting of all, unless expressly otherwise
provided by this code or by some other s1atute.
Conformable to the existing law.
§ 1255. The time within which an act is to be done,
as herein provided, must be computed, by excluding
the first day and including the last. If the last day be
Sunday, it must be excluded.
.Hmcnded Code, § 407.
§ 1256. The publication of' legal notices, required by
law, or by an orcler of a judge or court, to be published
in a newspaper once in each week, for a specified
number of weeks, must be made on the first day of
each week, in which such newspaper is published; an!!

week, the second publication must be made on Thurs-
day of each week, or if the paper be not issued and
published on Thursday, then on any other day in the
week on which such paper is issued. Md in all cases,
where a municipal corporation is required to publish
legal notices, and may designate the papers in which
the publication is to be made, it must make such der
ignation annually, by ordinance, for one year, and atlex
such designation, all such legal notices must be pub-
lished in the papers so designated.
The time for publication of legal notices must be
computed so as to exclude the first day of publication,
and to include the day on which the act or event, of
which notice is given, is to happen, or which complete;
the full period required for publication.
