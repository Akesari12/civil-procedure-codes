Judgment
may
be had if
the defendant fail to
answer the
complaint
as
follows:
1. In
any
action
arising
on
contract
for the
recovery
of
money
only,
the
plaintifff
may
file with the
clerk
proof
of
personal
service
of the
sum
mons and
complaint,
on one
or
more of the defendants,
or of the sum
mons
according
to
the
provisions
of section
99,
and
that
no
answer
has
been
received.
The court
shall
thereupon
enter
judgmentfor
the amount
mentioned
in the
summons,
against
the defendant
or
defendants,
or
against
one or
more of
the several defendants in the cases
provided
for in
section 105. But
if the
complaint
be not sworn to, and such
action be on
an instrument
for the
payment
of
money
only,
the court,
on
its
produc
tion shall assess the amount due to
the
plaintifff
thereon, and in other
cases
shall ascertain the amount
which the
plaintifff
is
entitled
to recover
in such
action from
his
examination,
under
oath,
or other
proof,
and en
ter the
judgment
for the
amount so assessed or ascertained. In case the
defendant
give
notice of
appearance
in
the
action,
he shall
be entitled
to five
days'
notice of the
time
and
place
of such assessment. Where
the
defendant,
by
his answer
in
any
such
action,
shall not
deny
the
plaintifff's
claim,
but shall set
up
a
counterclaim,
amounting
to less than
the
plain
tiffs
claim,
judgment may
be had
by
the
plaintifff
for
the
excess
of
said
claim over
the said
counterclaim,
in like manner in
any
such
action,
upon
the
plaintifffs
filing
with the clerk of the court a statement
admitting
such
counterclaim, which
statement shall be
annexed
to and
be a
part
of the
judgment
roll.
2. In
other
actions the
plaintifff
may,
upon
the like
proof, apply
to the
court, after
the
expiration
of the time
for
answering,
for
the relief
demand
ed in
the
complaint.
If the
taking
of an
account,
or
of the
proof
of
any
fact,
be
necessary
to enable the court
to
give
judgment,
or to
carry
the
judgment
into
effect,
the court
may
take
the account
or
hear
the
proof,
or.
may,
in its
discretion,
order a
reference for that
purpose.
And
where the
action is for the
recovery
of
money
only,
or of
specific
real or
personal
property,
with
damages
for the
withholding
thereof, the court
may
order
the
damages
to be assessed
by
a
jury,
or, if the examination
of a
long
account
be
involved,
by
a reference as
above
provided.
If
the
defendant
give
notice of
appearance
in the action before the
expiration
of the time
for
answering,
he shall
be
entitled to
eight
day's
notice
of the
time and
place
of
application
to the court
for the
relief
demanded
by
the
complaint.
3. In actions
where the service of the summons was
by publication,
the
plaintifff
may,
in
like
manner,
apply
for
judgment,
and the court must
thereupon
require proof
to be made of the demand mentioned in the com
plaint;
and
if the defendant be not a
resident
of

territory,
must re
