notice
of the justification
of' the sam1e,
or
other
bail
(specifying
the
places
of
residence
and
occupations

of the latter) before the judge of the court, or clerk,
at

be
not

than
five nor more
than ten
da"- thereafter,
except
by consent
of parties.
In case
other
ail
be given,
there
must be
a
new
undertaking.
SEC.
367.
The
qualifications
of
bail
are
as
follows:
1. Each of them shall be a resident, and householder,

or free holder, within the Territory;
2. Each must be worth the amount specified in the
order of arrest, or the amount to which the order is re-
duced,
as provided
in this
clpter,
over
and
above
all
his
debts and liabilities; exclus3ive of property, exempt fiom
execution; but the judge or clerk, on justification,
may
allow more than two sureties to justify severally in
amounts
less than that expressed in the order, if the whole justification

be equivalent to that of two sufficient bail.
dfication SEC. 368. For the lrpose of justification, each of the
bail must attend before the judge or clerk, at the time and
place mentioned in the notice, and may be examined on
oath,. on the part of the plaintifff, touching his sufficiency, in
such manner as the judge or clerk in his discretion may
think proper. The exauination must be reduced to
writing, and
subscribed by the bail, if required by the
plaintit
SEC.
369.
If
the
judge,
or
clerk,
find
the
bail
sufflicient,
lie

must annex the examination to the undertaking,
indorse his allowance thereon, and cause them to be filed,
and the officer is thereupon exonerated from liability.
SEC.
370.
The
defendant
may,
at
the
tilne
of
his
arrest, instead of giving bail, deposit with the
officer the
amount
mentioned
in
the
order.
In
case
the
amiount
of
the
bail be reduced, as provided in this Chapter, the defendant
may deposit such amount instead of' giving bail. In
either case, the officer must give
the defendant a certificate
of the deposit made, and the defendant must be discharged
from custody.
SEC. 371. The officer making the arrest, must, im-
mediately after the deposit, pay tie same into court, and
talce from file clerk receiving
the same, two certificates of
such payment, the one of whclll he must deliver or trans-
init to the plihntiftf or his attorney, and the other to the
defendant. For any default
in makling such payment, the
same proceedings may be had
on the official bond of the
officer to collect tie sum deposited as in other cases of do-
linquency.
SEC. 372. If money be deposited, as provided in 
the last
two
sections,
bail
may
be given,
and
may
justify 
upon notice at
any time before judgmnict; and on the filing
of the
undertaking
and justification
with tie
clerk, the
money deposited must be refunded to the defendant.

at
the
time
of
the
recovery
of
a
judg- 
ment
in
favor
of
the
plaintifff,
the
clerk
must,
under
the'plied
direction 
of
the
court,
apply
the
sat.e
in
satisfaction 
thereof, and after
satisfying the judgment
must refund tie
surl)lus,
if an), to the defendant.
If the jidgment be
in
favor of the defendant, the clerk must, under like direction
of the court, refund to hin the
whole sun deposited and
remaining unapplied.
SEC. 374. If after being arrested, the defendant
escape,
or
is
rescued,
file
officer
is
liable
as
bail;
but
he 
may
discharge
himself
from
such
liability
by giving
bail
at 
any time before judgment.
SEC. 375. If a judgment be recovered against the 
officer,
upon
his liability
as bail,
and
an
execution
tlreon 
is returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the same proceedings

may be had on his official bond for the recovery of
the whole or any deficiency, as in other cases of delinquency.
SEC. 376. A defendant arrested, may, at any
time
before the trial of the action, or if there be no trial, before 
the entry of
judgment, a)ply to the judge who made theorderof 
order,
or
the
court
in
which
the
action
is

the amount of bail. If the
application be made uo)n1 
affidavits
on the part of the deibn(lant, but not otherwise, file 
phintiff may oppose the satme by affidavits or other proofs
in addition to tlose on which the order of arrest was made.
SEC. 377. If upon application it appears that there
was
not
sufficient
(use
for
the
arrest,
the
order
nmiust
be 
vacated;

and such relief, or
any part thereof,
consists in restraining
the commission
or
continuance
of the act
complained of, either

2.
When it appears

within ten days
thereafter, be

allowed, the proposed bill
may
be
presented, with the amendments,
if any, to the judge
or
referee,
for settlement,
without notice to the
adverse party.
It is the duty of the judge or referee, in settling
the bill,
to strike out
of it all redundant
and useless
matter, so
that
the
exceptions may be presented
as briefly as possible.
When settled, the
bill must be signed
by the judge or
referee, with his certificate
to the effect that the same
is
allowed,
and shall then be filed with
the clerk.

as provided in Section

525, and
a bill thereof may be
presented and settled
afterwards,
as'provided in
Section 526, and within
like
periods
after the entry of the order,
upon appeal from
which
such decision is reviewable.
SEC. 528. If the
judge in any case refuse to
allow 
an
exception
in
accordance
with
the
facts,
the
party
desiring
the bill settled may
appl7, by petition, to
the supreme 
court to prove
the same. T'he application
may be niade in
the mode and
manner, and under such
regulhtions as that
court may prescribe;
and the bill, when pi-oven,
must be
certified
by a justice as correct,
and filed with the clerk
of
the court in which
the action was tried, and
when so filed,
it has the same force
and effect as if settled
by the judge
who tried the cause.
SEC. 529.
When the decision excepted
to Was made
by
any
judicial
officer
other
than
a judge,
the
bill
of
cx- 
ceptions shall
be presented to such judicial
officer, and be
settled
and signed by him,
in the same manner as
it is required

to

be presented to, settled
and signed by a court
or
judge.
A judge or judicial officer
may settle and sign a
bill of exceptions
afer, as well as before
he ceases to be
such judge
or judicial oilcer.

officer before the bill
of exceptions is settled,
dies, is re-
moved from office, becomes
disqualified, is absent
from the 
Territory, or
refuses to settle the
bill of exceptions, or
if
no mode is provided
by law for the settlement
of the same,
it
shall be settled and certified
in such manner
as the
supreme court may,
by its orders or fules,
direct. Judges,
judicial officers, and
the supreme court shall
respectively
possess
the same power in settling
and certifying statements,

as is
by this section conferred upon
them in settling
and certifying
bills of exceptions.

CI1AI~rER I.
ACtil8 for Foreclosure
of Mortgcags.
SEC.
606.
There
can
be but
one
action
for
the
re-
covery of
any debt, or the enforcement
of any right
secured
by
mortgage
upon
real
estate
or
personal
property,
which
action
must
be
in accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this Chapter.
In such action
the court may,
by its judgment,

direct

a sale
of the encumbered
property,
or sc. much
thereof
as may be
necessary and
the application
of the
proceeds
of the
sale to
the payment
of the
costs of the
court and
that expenses
of the sale,
and the
amount due
to
thb plaintifff;
and sales of
real estate under
judgments of
foreclosure
of mortgages and liens are subject to redemption

as

in case
of sales under
execution; and
if it appear
from the
return of
the officer
making
the sale
that the proceeds

are
insufficient,
and a balance
still
renmins due,
judg-
ment
can then
be docketed
for such
balance
against
the defendant

or

defentiants,
personally
liable
for the
debt, and k
becomes a
lien on the
real estate of
such judgment
debtor,
as
in other
cases, on which
execution
may
he issued.
No
pe:rson
holding a
conveyance
from or under
the mortgagor
of the
property
mortgaged,
or having
a lien thereon,
which
conveyance
or
lien does
not appear
of record
in the proper
office)
at the time of
the commencement
of
the action, need
be made
a party to
such action,
and the
judgment
therein
rendered,
and the
proceedings
therein
had, are as
conclusive
against the
party holding
such
unrecorded
conveyance,
or
lien as if
he had been
made a
party to the
action.
SEC. 607.
If there
be surplus
money
remaining
after
payment
of
the amount
due
on
the mortgage,
lien, or
in- 
cum)rance,
with
costs,
the
court
may
cause
the
same
to
be
paid to
the person
entitled to
it, and in the
meantime
may
direct
it to be deposited
in court.
SEc. 608.
If the
debt for which
the mortgage,
lien,
or
encumbrance is held, is not all
due, so soon as sufficient 
of the
)roperty
has been sold
to pay
the amount
due, with
costs,
the
sale
must
cease,
and
afterwards,
as
often
as
more 
becomes
due for
princi pal
or interest,
the court
may, on
motion,
order
more to
be sold.
But if the
property cannot

be sold
in portions,
without
injury
to the
parties, the
whole may
be ordered
to be sold
in the
first instance,
and
the
entire debt
and costs
paid, there
being
a rebate
of in-
terest where
such
rebate is
proper.

SEC. 866.
Upon such summons,

%;ithin
the
time
specified
therein,
denying
the judg-
nient, or setting u
p any
defense which may have arisen
i
subsequently, or he may deny his liability on the obligation

upon which the judgment
was recovered, except a
discharge from such liability )y the statute of limutations.
SE.
867.
If
the
(Iefin(lant,
in
his
answer,
deny
the
judgmnt, or set up fny
defense which may have arisen
subsequently, the summons, with the aildavit annexed, and
file answer, constitute the written allegations in the case;
if lie deny
his liability on the obligation upon which the
judgment was recovered, a copy of the original complaint
and utlgmieiit, the sunumr ois, wvith the alidavit annexed,
and the answer, constitute such written allegations.
SE.
868.
The
issues
formed
may
be
tried
as
in
other cases, but when the defendant (lenies, in his answer,
any liability on the obligation iiponi whieh the
judgment
was rendered, if a verdict Ibe found against him, it must be
for nt)t exceeding
the amount remaining unsatislied on such
original judgment, with interest thereon.

plaintifff accept
the offer, and give
notice thereof within
live days, he may file the offer, with proof of notice of
accel)tance, and the clerk must thereupon enter judgment
accordhingly. If the notice of aceltance be not given, the

evi(lence upon the trial; and if' the plaintifff fail to obtaii
a mre favorable judgment, he cannot recover costs, but
mast pay the defendant's costs from the time of thie offer.
