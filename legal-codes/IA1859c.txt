PRELIKINARY PROVISIONS. 
SECTION 2605. Remedies in civil cases in the courts of this state,
are divided into two classes-e-Ist, Actions; 2d, Special Proceedings, 
SEC. 2606. A civil action is a common proceeding in a court of jus� 
tice, by one party against another, for the enforcement or protection of 
a private right, or the redress or prevention of a private wrong. It 
may also be brought, in certain cases, for the recovery of a penalty or 
a forfeiture. 
� 
PART THIRD: 
TITLE. 
CHAPTER 108.t 
� 
� 
Sze. 2607. Every other remedy in a civil cue is a special pro� 
ceeding. 
� 
The proceeding supplementary to an execution is a special proceeding, per 
Willard, J., in Davis v. Turner, 4 P. R., 190, 192 ; and the proceeding to 
888e88 damages upon laying out a plank road, under chapter 21 O, of the laws
of 1847, ia most uadoubtedly what under the Code is denominated a special 
proceeding, per Ma10n, J., ex parte Ramom, 8 Code Rep., 148. Cited and
approved, 1 Kernan, 2 7 7. 
The proceeding upon a bond taken to suspend the sale of personal property
under an execution, can not be considered an action but more properly comes 
within that class of remedies denominated special or ffimmary _proceedings, 
and no written pleadings are allowable. Watson v. Gabbey, 18 B. M., 662. 
SEC. 2608. The forms of all actions and suits heretofore existing
are abolishedj and hereafter, there shall be but one form of action for
the enforcement or protection of private rights, and the redress or pre� 
vention of private wrongs, which shall be called a civil action." 
Sac. 2009. In such action the party oornpla.i.aing is known as the 
plaintifff, and the advene party as the defendant. 
.SEC. i610. The proceedings ia a civil action may be of two kinds; 
11 ordinary-2 equitable. 
SKc. 2611. The plaintiW may prosecute his action by equitable pro. 
eeedings, in all cases where courts of equity, before the adoption of thie 
eeae, bad junenenon ; an4 most eo proceed m au cases w nere suco. 
jurisdiction was exclusive. 
SEC. 2612. In all other cases, except in this code otherwise pro�
vided, the plaintifff must prosecute bis action by ordinary proceedings. 
SEC. 2613. An error of the plaintifff' as to the kind of proceedings
adopted. shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of the action, but 
merely a change into the proper proceedings, by an amendment in the
pleadings, and a transfer of the action to the proper docket. 
SEC. 2614. The error mentioned in the last section may be corrected 
by the plaintifff, without motion, at any time before the defendant. has
answered ; or, afterwards, on motion, in court. 
SEC. 2615. The defendant shall be entitled to have the correction
made, in the following cases :- Where the action has been commenced 
by equitable proceedings, the defendant, by motion made, at the time of
filing his answer, may have them changed into ordinary proceedings 
when it appears that by the provisions of section 2612, the plaintifff
should have adopted ordinary proceedings, and in addition that his
answer presents a defense on which he is entitled to trial by jury. 
A prayer in an answer to transfer the action to the one or the other side
of the court, is not equivalent to a motion to transfer. Duvall, J., Lander Y. 
Nunn, }lss. opinion, September, 1857. Cited from Ky. Code by Stanton. 
SEC. 2616. Where the action has been commenced by ordinary
proceedings, the defendant, by motion made, at, or before, the time of 
filing his answer, may have them changed into equitable proceedings 
when it appears� that, by the provisions of section 2611, the plainti1F 
ihould have adopted equitable proceedings. 
SEC. 2til 7. Where the action has been properly commenced by 
irdinary proceedings, either party shall have the right, by motion, to 
iave any issue, which before the adoption of this oode was exclusively
eognizable in equity, tried in the manner hereinafter prescribed in cases 
>f equitable proceedings ; and if all the issues are such as, before the
idoption of this code, were cognizable in equity, though none were 
~xclusi,�ely so, the defendant shall be entitled to have them all tried as 
n cases of equitable proceedings. 
\Vhere the answer of a defendant to an ordinary petition sets up an
squitable def ense, the trial of the issue should be as in case of equitable 
oroceedings, and if the equitable defense be adjudged insufficient. and there 
JC a legal issue, that should be referred to a Jury, unless a jury be waived
n some of the modes pointed out by� the code. SmiLh v . .illoberlg, 15 B. M., 
73. 
SEC. 2618. If the plaintifff's claim is for money due by contract,
md the defendant puts in a defense of exclusively equitable cognizance,
1pon the plaintifff filing an affidavit that he verily believes that he will 
succeed in the action, and that the collection of his claim after judg�
ment will be endangered by the delay arising from such defense being
put in, the court shall require the defendant to give security for the pay� 
ment of any judgment the plaintifff may obtain in the action, and upon 
his failure to give such security, shall order the defendant to pay into
court an amount sufficient to discharge the plaintifff 's claim and his prob�
able costs; UJ)()ll which order execution may be issued ~ upon a judg� 
ment, and the amount collected upon execution shall be brought into
court and await the decision of the action, and be paid to the plaintifff or
defendant, according to such decision. But no such security shall be
required if the trial of the equitable defense takes place during the term 
it which it is put in, nor until all defenses to the action, other than those 
of equitable cognizance, are tried or disposed of in favor of the plain� 
tiff. 
SEC. 2619. An error as to the kind of proceedings adopted in the 
action, is waived by failure to move for its correction at the time and in
the manner prescribed in this chapter ; and all errors in the decisions of 
the court, on any of the motions named in this chapter, are waived,
unless excepted to at the time; which may be done by the clerk noting 
at the end of such decision words of the following import : '' T o which
decision the plain tiff ( or defendant) excepts." 
The code requires that when the petition is in equity, when it should have
been at law, and at law when it should have been in equity, it is to be reached 
by motion, and if not so moved, the error is waived. Trustees of Lebanon 
v. Forrest, etc., 15 B. M., 172. 
SEC. 2620. The provisions of this code concerning the prosecution 
of a civil action, apply to both kinds of proceedings, whether ordinary
or equitable, unless the contrary appears." 
8Ec. 2621. Judgment obtained in an action by ordinary proceed�
Ings, shall not be annulled or modified by any order in an action by 
equitable proceedings, except for a defense which has arisen or been
discovered since the judgment was rendered. But such judgment does 
not prevent the recovery of any claim, though such claim might have 
been used by way of set-off counterclaim, or cross-demand, in the action
on which the judgment Wai recovered. 
SEc. 2622. The rule of the common law that statutes in derogation
thereof are to be strictly construed, has no application to this code. Its
provisions and all proceedings under it, shall be liberally construed with
a view to promote its object and assist the parties in obtaining justice."

CHAPTER 113. 
[ Code-Chapter 94. 1 
CONTEKPTS. 
SEC. 2691. (1601.) But if the contempt consists in an omission to 
perfonn an act which is yet in the power of the person to perform, he 
may be imprisoned until he performs it. In that case the act to be per� 
formed must be specified in the warrant of .eommitment, 
SEC. 2692. (1602.) Unless the contempt is committed in the imme�
diate view and presence of the court, or comes officially to its knowl� 
edge, an affidavit showing the nature of the transaction is necessary as 
a basis for further action in the premi~es. 
SEC. 2698. (1603.) Before punishing for a contempt, unless the 
off'ender is already in the presence of the court, he must be served per�
sonally with a rule to show cause against the punishment, and a reason� 
able time given him therefore; or he may be brought before the court
forthwith, or on a given day, by warrant, if necessary. In either case 
he may, at his option, make a written explanation of his conduct under 
oath, which must be filed and preserved. 
SEC. 2694. (1604.) Where the action of the court is founded upon
evidence given by others, such evidence must be in writing, and be filed

premises, a statement of the facts upon which the order is founded, must 
be entered on the records of the court, or be filed and preserved when 
the court keeps no record. 
SEC. 2695. (1605.) When the off'ender is committed, the warrant
must state the particular facts and circumstances on which the conn 
acted in the premises, and whether the same was within the knowledge
of the court, or was proved by witnesses. 
SEC. 2696. (1606.) No appeal lies to an order to punish for a con� 
tempt, but the proceedings may, in proper cases, be taken to a higher
court for revision by certiorari. 
SEC. 2697. (1607.) The punishment for a contempt constitutes no

made for the benefit of another, or a party expressly authorized by 
statute, may sue in his own name without joining with him the party for
whose benefit the suit is prosecuted. 
SEC. 2759. All persons having an interest in the aubject of the.
action, and in obtaining the relief demanded, may be joined as plaintifffS, 
except where it is otherwise provided in this code. 
SEC. 2760. In case of an assignment of a thing in action, the action by 
the assignee shall be without preju4ice to any set-off or other defense 
existing before notice of the assignment; but this section shall not apply 
to negotiable instruments transferred in good faith and upon valuable 
consideration before due. 
SEO. 2761. Any person may be made a defendant who has or claims
an interest in the controversy adverse to the plaintifff; or who is a nec� 
essary party to a complete determination or settlement of the question
involved in the action. 
SEO. 2762. ( 1679.) Persons having an united interest must be 
joined on the same side, either as plaintifffs or defendants. But when
some who should thus be made plaintifffs refuse to join, they may be
made defendants; the reasons thereof being set forth in the petition. 
SEC. 2763. (1680.) When the question is one of a common or gen� 
eral interest to many persons, or when the parties are very numerous
and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more 
may sue or defend fort.he benefit of the whole. 
SEC. 2764. Where two or more persons are bound by contract, or
by judgment, decree or statute, whether jointly only or jointly and sev� 
erally, or severally only, and including the parties to negotiable paper,
common orders, and checks, and sureties on the same, or separate instru� 
ments-the action thereon may, at the plaintifff's option, be brought
against any or all of them. When any of those so bound are dead, the
action may be brought against any or all the survivors, with any or all of
the representatives of the decedents-or against any or all such repre�
sentatives. An action or judgment against any one or more of several 
persons jointly bound, shall not be a bar to proceedings against the
others. 
SEO. 27 65. The court may determine any controversy between par�
ties before it when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of oth�
ers, or by saving their rights. But when a determination of the contro�

presence of other parties, the court must order them to be brought in. 
SEc. 27 66. When in an action for the recovery of real or personal
property, any person having an interest in the property applies to be 
made a party, the court may order it to be done by the proper amend�
ment. 
A person not a party but having an interest, can not be made a party to an 
~tion on contract to recover money. This section must be confined to actions
for the recovery of real or specific personal property. Judd v. You,1g, 7 Pr. 
B., 79. 
The provision allowing a third person to be made a party, extends only to
actions for the recovery of real or personal property, and not to an action in 
the nature of a creditor's bill. Tallman v. Hollister, 9 Pr. R., 608. 
SEC. 2767. Upon affidavit of a defendant before answer in any ac�
tion upon contract for the recovery of personal property, that some third 
party without collusion with him, has, or makes a claim to the subject of
the action, or on proof thereof as the court may direct, the court may 
make an order for the safe keeping, or for the payment or deposit in 
court, or delivery of the subject of the action to such person as it may 
direct, and an order requiring such third person to appear in a reason�
able time and maintain or relinquish his claim against the defendant, and 
in the mean time stay the proceedings. H such third party, being served
with a copy of the order, fails to appe.ar, the court may declare him 
barred of all claim in respect to the subject of the action against the de� 
fendant therein. If such third person appears, he shall be allowed to
make himself defendant in the action in lieu of the original defendant
who shall be discharged from all liability to either of the other parties, 
in respect to the subject of the action upon bis compliance with the order 
of the court for the payment, deposit, or delivery thereof. 
SEc. 27 68. The provisions of the la.st section shall be applicable to 
an action brought against a sheriff, or other officer, for the recovery of
personal property taken by him under an attachment or execution, or for
the proceeds .of such property so taken and sold by him. And the de�
fendant in any such action shall be entitled to the benefit of these pro�
visions against the party in whose favor the attachment or execution
issued, upon exhibiting to the court the process under which he acted, 
with his affidavit that the property, for the recovery of which, or its pro� 
ceeds, the action was brought, was taken under such process. 
SEC. 2769. In an action against a sheriff; or other officer, for the
recovery of property taken under an attachment or execution, the court
~ay, upon the application of the defendant and of the party in whose
favor the process issued, permit the latter to be substituted as the de� 
fendant, sureties for the costs being given. 
SEc. 2770. An action to recover the possession of specific personal
property taken under a landlord's attachment, when it is brought by the
tenant or his assignee or under-tenant, may be against the party who sued 
out the attachment; and the property claimed by such action, may, under
the writ therefore, be taken from the officer who seized it, when he has no 
other claim to hold it than that derived from the writ.. The indorsement 
of a levy on the property made upon the process by the officer holding it, 
shall be a sufficient taking of the property to sustain the action against 
the party who sued out the writ. 
SEO. 2771. When a married woman is a party, her husband must 
be joined with her, except that
1. When the action concerns her separate property, or is founded on 
her own conn-act, she may sue and be sued alone.
2. When the action is. between herself and her husband, she may sue 
and be sued alone. And in no case need she prosecute or def end by 
guardian or next friend." 
SEc. 2772. When sued alone, judgment shall be enforced against 
her separate property. 
SEc. 2773. When suing alone, judgment may be. enforced against 
her separate property, or her husband being bro~ht in by rule, execu�
tion may issue against him also, unless for cause he show that he is not
interested in the suit by the wife. 
SEC. 277 4. If husband and wife are sued together, the wife may de�
fend for her own right ; and if either neglect to defend, the other may 
def end for such one also, 
SEO. 2775. In an action brought by a man and his 1vife for an in� 
jury done to the wife, in respect of� which she is necessarily joined as 
co-plaintifff it shall be lawful for the husband to join thereto claims in 
his .own right. 
SEC. 2776. When a husband, teing a father, bas deserted his family,

same powers and rights therein as he might have had. 
SEO. 2777. The action of an infant must be brought by his guardian 
or next friend ; but the court has powE:r to dismiss it if it is not for the
benefit of the infant, or to substitute the guardian of the infant or other
person as next friend. 
SE~. 2778. The defense of an infant must be by bis regular guard� 
ian, or by a guardian appointed to defend him, where no regular guard� 
ian appears, or where the court directs a defense by a guardian ap�
pointed for that purpose. No judgment ~n be rendered against an 
infant until after a defense bv a zuardien, 
SEC. 2779. The appointment can not be made until after service oi 
the notice in the action as directed by this code, and may then be made 
by the court or judge thereof, or during vacation by the clerk of the dis�
trict court; but the court shall have power to remove such guardian and 
appoint another instead, whenever the interests of the infant requires
such a change. 
SEC. 2780. The appointment may be made upon the application of 
the infant if he is of the age of fourteen years, and applies at or before 
the term to which the notice is served. If' he is under the age of four�
teen, or does not so apply, the appointment may be made upon the 
application of any friend of the infant, or on that of the plaintifff in the 
� 
action. 
SEO. 2781. The action of a person of unsound mind, must be
brought by his guardian, or if he has none, by his next friend. When
brought by his next friend, the action is subject to the power of the 
court 'in the same manner as the action of an infant so brought, 
SEC. 2782. The defense of an action against a person of unsound

the allegation of the truth of the matter charged shall not, if the def end�
ant fail to establish it, be deemed, in itself, proof of the malice of such
words, but the jury shall decide upon the whole ease, whether such
defense was, or was not, made with malicious intent, and whether he
prove the justlficatlon or not, he may give in evidence the .mltigating
circumstances, but each defense must be separately stated and numbered, 
and if the defendant relies on more than one mitigating circumstance 
sufficient in law to reduce the amount of damages, each of such circum�
stances must be separately stated and numbered, and sufficient in itself,
and if the defendant relies on the troth of the matter charged, nothing 
herein is intended to relax the law of pleading heretofore in force, as 
� � 
SEc. 2930. Any person shall- be entitled to intervene in an action
who has an interest in the matter in litigation, in the success of either of
the parties to the action, or an interest against both. An intervention 
takes place when a third party is permitted to become a party to an 
action between other persons, either by joining the plaintifff in claiming
what is soughtby the petition, or by uniting with the defendant in re� 
sisting the claim of the plaintifff, or by demanding any thing adversely
to both the plaintifff and defendant. A third person may intervene 
either before or after issue has been joined in the cause, and before the
trial commences. 
SEc. 2931. The court shall determine upon the intervention at the 
same time that the action is decided, and the intervenor has no right to
delay ; and if the claim of the intervenor is not sustained, he shall pay 
all costs of the intervention. 
SEC. 2932. The intervention shall be by petition filed in the court 
in which the action is pending, and it must set forth the facts constituting 
the grounds on which the intervention rests, and shall be taken notice of 
by the adverse party, as any other pleading, on being served by copy, 
and shall be responded to in the time which is allowed for other plead�
ings of the kind used in such response, and all the pleadings therein
shall be governed by the same principles and rules as obtain in other 
pleadings provided for in this chapter. But if such petition is filed
during term, the court shall direct the time in which an answer shall be 
filed thereto. � 
SEC. 2933. In a proceeding against a married woman, growing out
of any contract which she may have the legal right to make, the plead- 
ing need not state facts constituting a cause against her with respect to 
her separate property, but need only state facts constituting a cause of 
action, or set-off, or counterclaim, or cross-demand, against her as a 
person, and judgment shall be personal � 
SEC. 2984. One cause of action, defense, set-off, counterclaim, cross�
demand, or reply, shall be expressed in but one statement, and not in
various counts or divisions. If such be done, the adverse party may 
move to strike out all but one of such counts or divisions, supporting
his motion by an affidavit that the same are for only one cause of action, 
whereupon the other party shall either so strike out at the cost of the 
motion, or declining, must show on the trial as many distinct causes as 
he has counts or divisions, or shall pay all the costs of the whole trial.� 
SEC. 2935. Where a transaction has taken place between the plain� 
tiff and defendant, constituting in favor of the plaintifff a cause of action
against the defendant, and where another contemporaneous or subsequent
transaction growing out of and based upon the former transaction, bas 
also taken place between them, which may or may not have operated a 
merger or displacement of the former cause of action then, if such 
plaintifff is not clear upon� which of such transactions he is entitled to 
recover, he may state in his petition, in distinct counts, the facts consti� 
tuting each of such causes of action, and may pray for the relief proper
to each cause of action, and must also state that he claims to recover but 
for one of such causes ; whereupon the defendant may allow judgment 
to go against him on either of such causes in bar of the other ; or if 
the defendant contests both of such causes, the plaintifff may, on proper
proof, recover on either, or having obtained verdict on both, may state 
on which one he will have judgment, which judgment shall be in bar of 
the other.
The same principles shall obtain in regard to a set-off, counterclaim, 
or cross-demand. t 
SEc. 2936. �Where a transaction has occurred, and if certain facts
thereof should be proved, such proof would entitle the plaintifff to one 
kind or degree of relief, while if other facts thereof were proved, such 
proof woold entitle the plaindW to another kind or 4iegree of relief;
then if file plainti1F can not determine which group of fadl he can 
prove, but believes he am prove the one or the othez of soch groups, he
may state as cause . of action in distinct counts, each of such group of 
facts, with the relief which he demands thereon, and that he asks judg�
ment only on ooe of such gtvbp of fads. Whereupon the parties shall 
have the aame rights, and the eame proceedings may be bad as are pro� 
vided for in aectioo 2985, and the verification of the eaueee of action of 
this sect.ion shall be in eWect d,at the plaint.iW believes one or the other 
of them true, but can not determine which.�

in an answer or reply, and when the pleading is verified, it must be to 
the same effect as required in the last section.

may do so jointly. � 
SEC. 2939. The pleading may include one count only when the same 
contract was made by each of the adverse parties, but must include

when, u in the case of maker and indorser, the same contract was not 
made by all,

general law, or when his claim is founded upon an exception of any 
kind, he shall set forth such claim or such exception particularly in his
pleading. 
SEo. 294:1. Propositions which state matters of law, as contra-dis� 
tinguished from those which 1tate matters of faee, moat not be stated in
a pleading, but if a proposition which has a meaning which would make 
it matter of law has also another and a common sense meaning, which 
would make it matter of fact, it aha.II be taken in the latter meaning ancl 
shall be deemed a proposition of fact. t 
� 
SEC. 2942. Any defense showing that .a contract, written or oral, or 
my instrument sued on; is void or voidable ; or the fact that the alleged
instrument was delivered to a third person, as an escrow, or showing 
matter of justification, excuse, discharge, or release, and any cause of
defense which admits the facts of the adverse pleading, but by some 
other matter seeks to avoid their legal effect, must be specially pleaded. 
SEC. 2943. Any defense that admits that an allegation of� the other
pleading is true, as an allegation of fact, but assumes that it is not true 
as an allegation of law, and seeks to avoid it by new matter, must be
specially pleaded. . 
SEo. 2944. Under a mere denial of an allegation, no evidence shall 
be introduced by the party so denying, which does not tend to negative
such an allegation of fact, or to negative some proposition of fact, as 
eontradistinguished from one of law, which the party having made the 
controverted allegation, is bound to prove, in order to sustain such alle� 
gation. � 
8Bc. 2945. Proposition& which are statements of evidence, as COD� 
&radistinguished from propositions which are atatementa of the ultimate
results of evidence, should not be stated in any pleading."

thereby, cause irrelel'&Bt or redundant matter to be stricken from any
pleadings, at the cost of any party, whose pleading eontains them. 
SEC. 2947. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essential to 
the claim or defense, and which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insufficient. 
SEC. 2948. When the facts on which any pleading is founded, are 
stated in a manner so general, or so indefinite, orso uncertain that the
precise nature of the cause of action, or defense, or set-off, or counter� 
claim, or cross-demand is not so apparent as to enable the adverse 
party to respond intelligibly thereto, the court may, on motion, require 
the pleading to be made more specific, definite, and certain by amend�
ment, and no pleading which recites or refers to a contract, shall be 
deemed sufficiently specific, unless it states whether the same is in writ�
ing or not. Such motion shall point out wherein the amendment is 
required or shall be disregarded, and if the reason for such demand of
more specific statement exists outside of the pleadings, the motion must 
state the same and be sworn to. 
. SEC. 2949. The title of a cause shall not be changed in any of ita
stages of transit. from one court to another.

of the ease. 
SEc. 2955. When time forms a material point in the merits of a 
cause, the day, month, and year, or when there is a continued act, the
period of its duration must be alleged. Wl1en time is not material, it

describe the property, and when the injury is to an incorporeal heredita� 
meot, shall describe the property in respect of which the right is claimed,

claim is barred by the statute of limitations, it may be assailed by
demurrer. 
SEC. 2962. When the defendant pleads the statute of limitations,
responding to such plea, the plaintifff may, without leave or C03t, or incur� 
ring delay, amend his petition, by a count averring as another cause of
action, the proper admission or new promise, with what other matter
may be necessary to constitute sufficient cause of such claim, and the
plaintifff may recover on either of such claims as he may show himself
entitled. But he may in the first instance, rely on and state as cause of 
action, the matter displacing the bar of the statute as contemplated in the
amendment herein stated. 
SEc. 2963. When any pleading shows affirmatively, that its cause
of claim should be evidenced by writing, according to the law of evi�
dence, and that the same is not so evidenced, it may be assailed by 
demurrer.
SEo. 2964. Where such cause of action, set-off, counterclaim, or 
cross-demand, as should be evidenced by writing, is so evidenced, then
the same must be stated to be so, and the writing, or a copy thereof,
must be annexed to the pleading, unless a reasonable excuse be set forth
in the pleading for not annexing the same, else it shall not be received 
in proof on trial.

in action for goods, or their value ; the statement of promises which
were not in fact made, and which need not be proved, and all statements
of a like kind, shall be omitted. 
SEC. 29ti6. If a party state mo?e facts, or a greater title or estate
than is necessary to entitle him to the relief claimed, and such facts, 
estates, or title be denied to the full extent, he shall not be compelled to
prove more than is necessary to constitute a claim to the relief prayed,
or to any lower degree of relief, included in the relief prayed. And if

hA shall not. hP. r.nmnP.11P.il tn nrnvA more than is needed fnr his defense. 
SEC. 2967. When the action, defense, set-off, counterclaim or cross� 
demand is founded on a written instrument, and the original is ref erred 
to in a pleading, and annexed thereto, the genuineness and due execu�
tion of such instrument shall be deemed admitted, unless the adverse party 
in response to such pleading, if it is one which may be responded to, and if 
it be not, then before the trial deny the genuiness of execution of the
same by affidavit; and when any other writing, purporting to have been 
executed by one of the parties is ref erred to in, and filed with a plead-
ing, it may be read against such party as genuine and duly executed, 
unless he denies the same by affidavit, before the trial is begun. 
Sso. 2968. Either. party may be allowed, on motion, to make a sup�
plemental petition, answer or reply, alleging facts material to the case, 
which have happened or have come to his knowledge since the filing oC 
the former petition, answer, or reply, nor shall such new pleading be
considered a waiver of former pleadings,

action, shall be stated according to the fact, without any formal com�
mencement or conclusion, and any answer which does not state whether
the defense therein set up arose before or after action, shall be deemed

SEC. 2971. The forms contained in schedule A to this act annexed
shall be sufficient, and those and t.he like forms may be used with such
modifications as may be necessary to meet the facts of the case ; but
nothing herein contained shall render it erroneous or irregular to depart
from the letter of such forms so long as the substance is expressed with� 
out prolixity. 
.Amendment.. 
SEc. 2972. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and
the proof is to be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the
adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon 
the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has been so misled,
that fact must be shown by proof oliunde to the satisfaction of the court,
and such proof must also show in what respect he has been so misled, 
and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended upon
such terms as may be just.� 
SEC. 2973. When the variance is not material as provided in the
last section. the court may direct the fact to be found according to the 
evidence, and may order an immediate amendment without costs. 
SEC. 297 4. When, however, the allegation of the claim or defense
to which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some particular or par� 
ticulars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed
a case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

any time before the answer is filed, without prejudice to the proceedings
already had ; but a notice of such amendment shall be served on the
defendant or his attorney, and the defendant .shall have the same time� to

in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, permit 
such party to amend any pleadings or proceedings by adding or striking 
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a 
party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations
material to the case, or when the amendment does not change substan�
tially the claim or defense by conforming the pleadings or proceedings 
to the facts proved. The court may likewise, in its discretion, on terms, 
and for good cause proved, allow an answer or reply to be filed after the 
time limited by this code, when such time has not been by order ex�
tended. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party, fails, in any 
respect to conform to the provisions of this code, it may permit an amend�
ment of such proceeding so as to make it conformable thereto. 
SEC. 2978. The court must, in every stage of an action, disregard
any error or defect in the proceeding, which does not affect t.he substan� 
tial rights of the adverse party ; and no judgment shall be reversed or 
affected by reason of such error or defect. 
SEC. 2979. When either party shall amend any pleading or pro�
ceeding, the case shall not be continued in consequence thereof, unless 
the court shall be satisfied by affidavit or otherwise, that the adverse 
party could not be ready for trial in consequence of such amendment.
But if the court is thus made to become satisfied, a continuance may 
be granted to some day in the same term, or to the next term of said
court. 
SEC. 2980. Whene~er two or more actions are pending in the same
court which might have been joined, the defendant may, on motion, and 
notice to the adverse party, require him to show cause why the same
shall not be consolidated, and if no sufficient cause be shown, the same 
shall be consolidated. �
SEc. 2981. Courts may permit the amendments authorized by this 
chapter to be made, without being verified as prescribed in section 2904,
unless a new and distinct cause of action, defense, set-off, counterclaim, 
or cross-demand is thereby introduced. 
SEC. 2982. If an original pleading be lost or withheld by any one,
the court may order a t'Opy thereof to be substituted. 
SEC. 2983. All matters of supplement or amendment, whether of
addition or subtraction, shall be made not by erasure or interlineation of 
the original, or by addition thereto, but upon a separate paper, which
shall be filed, and shall constitute, with the original, but one pleading. 
But if it be stated in such paper,. that it is a substitute for the former
pleading intended to be amended, in that case it shall be deemed such 
substitute, but the pleading superseded by the substitute shall not b 
withdrawn from the files.

party interrogating and the party answering. 
SEC. 2986. The party answering shall not be confined to respond 
ing merely to the interrogatories, but may state any new matter con 
ceming the same cause of action, which shall likewise be read as I 
deposition. 
Ssq. 2987. These shall be answered at the same time the petition i: 
required to be answered, and when annexed to the answer or reply, shal
be answered at or before the calling of the cause for trial, if such plead
ing has been filed four clear days. 
SEC. 2U88. The trial of an action by ordinary proceedings shall no 
be postponed on account of the failure to answer interrogatories, if th4 
party interrogated is present in court at the trial, so that he may bt 
orally examined; nor, in ease of his absence, unless an affidavit be fllec
showing the facts, the party believes will be proved by the answen
thereto, and that the party has not filed the interrogatories for the pur�
pose of delay ; whereupon, if the party will consent that the facts statec 
in the affidavit shall be considered as admitted. by those interrogated, th~ 
trial shall not be postponed for that cause. 
SEC. 2989. The party in answering such interrogatories, shall dis� 
tinguish clearly between what is stated from his personal knowledge 
and what is stated from information or belief merely. An unqualified 
statement of a fact shall be considered as made of his personal knowl
edge. 
SEC. 2990. The answers to the interrogatories shall be verified bj

affidavit that he verily believes the subject of the interrogatories, or anJ
of them, is in the personal knowledge of the opposite party, and that his 
answers thereto, if truly made from such knowledge, will sustain the 
claim of defense, or any part thereof, and the opposite party shall fail tc 
answer therein within the time allowed therefore, or by the court ex�
tended, the claim or defense, or the part thereof, according to such affi� 
davit, shall be deemed to be sustained, and judgment given accord�
ingly.

CHAPTER 123.* 
(Code-Chapter 105.) 
TRIAL AND ITS INCIDENTS. 
SEC. 2993. Issues arise in the pleadings where a fact or conclusion
of law is maintained by one party and controverted by the other. They 
are of two kinds : Ist, of law ; 2d, of fact. 
SEC. 2994. An issue of fact arises, I. Upon a material allegation
of fact in the petition denied by the answer. 2. Upon a material alle� 
gation of fact in a set-off, counterclaim, or cross-demand, presented in 
the answer and denied by the reply. 3. Upo11 allegations of fact 
being new matter, in the answer or reply, which shall be considered as
controverted by the opposite party without further pleading. 
SEC. 2995. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the petition,
answer, or reply, or to .some part of either, or upon any allegation of 
fact in a pleading by the one party, the truth of which is neither con�
troverted by the other party nor by the law for him. 
SEc. 2996. Issues both of law and fact may arise upon different
parts of the pleadings in the same action. In such cases the issues of
law must be first tried; but by going to trial on an issue of fact without
objection, a party will be deemed to have waived his demurrer. 
SEC. 2997. A trial is a judicial examination of the issues in an
action, whether they be issues of law or of fact, 
SEC. 2998. Issues of law must be tried by the court, unless referred
as provided in section 3089. An issue of fact in an action by ordinary
proceedings, must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial shall be waived,
as pro, .. ided in section 8087, or a reference be ordered, as provided in 
section 8090. 
How J?quitalJle I,,ua Tritd. 
SEC. 2999. Equitable issues may be tried according to two distinct
methods, called first and second methods of equitable trials, and these 
methods shall differ one from the other in the following particulars, and
none others : � 
1. As to the form of evidence. In all cases tried according to the
first method, all the evidence shall be in writing, while in those eases 
tried by the second method, the evidence shall be as in ordinary actions.
2. As to who may determine the facts therein. In a trial by the first 
method, the issues shall be tried by the court, who may, however, to in�
form his conscience, order the whole issue, or any part thereof, or any
specific question of fact involved therein, to be tried by a jury, or may 
refer the same, and may in either case accept or reject the finding of the
jury or referee, and may, with or without a statement of any finding of 
facts, render such judgment as he considers equitable. ,v bile in a trial 
by the second method, either party shall be entit.led to have the whole
issue or any part thereof, or any specific question of fact involved therein,
tried by a jury, under the instructions of the court, as in a case by or�
dinary proceedings, or to have the same tried by the court acting as a 
jury, and finding in writing the facts, which finding of facts in either 
case shall be of ultimate facts and not of evidence of such facts, and
shall be stated on the record as a special verdict, and the judgment of
the court shall be the legal conclusions based upon and supported by the
facts so found as herein contemplated. 
8. As to what �is triable on appeal. In an appeal taken on a case
tried in the first method, a1l the evidence shall go to the supreme court.,
which shall try the case on both the law and facts as apparent of record.
,vhile in cases tried by the second method, no evidence shall, on appeal, 
go to the supreme court, except such as may be necessary to explain and
apply any bill of exceptions, and such court shall try only the legaJ
errors thereof, duly presented, as in a case by ordinary proceedings, in�
eluding the sufficiency of the facts stated on the record, as the basis ol
the judgment to warrant the same. 
SKc. 8000. The first method shall obtain in all cases, except, 11 
In divorce cases. 2. In foreclosure of tax-title cases, and of mortgages! 
3. In default cases. 4. In cases where all the parties thereto consent 
to try by the second method, in which cases the second method shall 
obtain. 
SEC. 8001. The consent in the last section contemplated, must be
expressed in open court, and entered of record, or must be in writing 
and signed by the parties or the attorney of the parties, and filed in the 
cause. 
SEc. 3002. The plaintifff in his petition, or the defendant in his
answer, may state his consent to try the case by the second method, and 
if the other party, within ten days thereafter, file his consent thereto in 
the clerk's- office, the cause shall be so tried. 
SEC. 3003. Or if all the parties at any time before trial enter into 
such consent, the cause shall be so tried. 
Precedence of Oau,u. 
SEC. 3004. A civil cause shall not be tried save by consent of the
bar, in any other order than that in which it stands upon the docket, 
SEC. 3005. The clerk shall keep a calendar of all the causes pend�
ing in his court, arranging in one part thereof, criminal causes, in the
order of their commencement ; in another part thereof, ordinary actions, 
in the same order; and in another, equitable actions, in the same order,
and shall enter the causes thereon as soon as the same arc commenced, . 
by the filing of the petition or transcript therein, and shall, under the
direction of the court or judge, apportion the same to as many days of
the term, as shall be thought nece5sary, and shall on the order of any 
party, in any cause, issue subpoenas for witnesses returnable on the-�
day on which such cause is set for trial, and the clerk shall furnish at
such term, the court and the bar, each, with a copy of such calendar. 
SEC. 3006. The criminal causes shall flrst be called in their order,
and disposed of by trial, or continuance, in such order, unless the court
for good cause shall direct otherwise, and after the civil calendar is en�
tered upon, no criminal cause shall be allowed to intervene. But the
court shall not protract the trial of the civil causes beyond a day of the
term after which all defendants in criminal causes who desire to be tried
at such term, mny be so tried, during which re-entry upon the criminal
calendar, the causes shall be tried, or continued, in their order. 
SEC. 8007. Except when otherwise provided, causes shall be tried
at the first term after due, legal and timely service has been made, unless
reasonable cause for continuance be shown. 
Continuance. 
SEC. 3008. When time is asked for making application for a con�

SEO. 3030. (2975.) A challenge to the panel must be taken before
a juror is sworn, and must be in writing, specifying plainly and dis�
tinctly the facts constituting the ground of challenge. 
Sso. 3031. (2976.) A challenge to the panel may be taken by 
either party, and upon the trial thereof, the officers, whether judicial or

the jury must be discharged, so far as the trial in question is con�
cerned ; if it be disallowed, the court shall direct the jury to be im�

peremptory or for cause. 
SEC. 3034. (2979.) It must be taken when the juror appears and

1. For such a bias as, when the existence of the fact is ascertained, 
in judgment of law disqualifies the juror, and which is known in this
chapter as implied bias. 
2. For the existence of a state of mind on the part of the juror in
reference to the case, which, in the exercise of a sound discretion, leads 
to the inference that he will not act with entire impartiality, and which
is actual bias. 
SEC. 8040. A challenge for implied bias may be taken for an or any 
of the following causes, and for no other: 
1. Consanguinity or affinity within the ninth degree, 1o the adverse

regards the liability of the adverse party, or on the merits of the COil�

sworn, or after, agree to take the verdict of the majority, which agree� 
ment being stated to the court and stated on the record to have beea 
made, shall bind the parties, and in such case a verdict signed by any 
seven or more and duly rendered, when read and not disapproved by
said majority, shall, in every particular, be as binding as if made by a 
full jury; or when both parties require it a struck jury may be ordered; 
whereupon eighteen jurors shall be called into the box, and the plaintifff

upon interlocutory questions, the party moving the court or objecting to

party excepting must reduce his exception to writing, and present it 
to the court for its signature. If the judge deems it true he shall sign 
it. If he does not deem it true, he shall at once state to the party ofter-

any of the following causes affecting materially the substantial rights
of such party :

vailing party, or any order of court or referee, or abuse of discretion, 
by which the party WM prevented from having a fair trial. 
2. Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party.

large or too small, where the action is upon a contract or for the injury 
or detention of property. �

evidence, or is contrary to law.
7. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party applying, which 
he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced 
at the trial.
8. Error of law occurring at the trial, excepted to by the party mak- 
ing the application. � . 
Sso. 3113. A nCw trial shall not be granted on account of the 
smallness of damages in an action for an injury to the person or repu� 
tation, nor in any other action where the damages shall equal the actual
pecuniary injury sustained. 
SEC. 3114. The application for a new trial must be made at the tet,n
the verdict, report or decision is rendered, and except for the cause of 
newly discovered evidence, material for the party applying, which he
could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the 
trial, shall be within three days after the verdict or decision was ren�
de red. 
SEC. 3115. The application must be made by motion upon written 
grounds, filed at the time of making the motion, the causes enumerated
in sub-divisions two, three, and seven, of section 3112, must be sustained 
by affi(ilvits showing their truth, and may be controverted by affidavits,
SEc. 3116. '\Vhere the grounds for a new trial could not with rea� 
sonable diligence have been discovered before, but are discovered after
the term at which the verdict, report of referee, or decision was rendered 
or made, the application may be made by petition, filed as in other cases, 
not later than the second term after the discovery; on which notice shall 
be served and returned as an original notice, and the defendant held to 
appear as in an original action. The facts stated in the petition shall 
be considered as denied, without answer, The case shall be tried as
other cases, by ordinary proceedings, but no pet.ition shall be filed more 
than one year after the final judgment was rendered. 
SEC. 3117. The costs of all new trials shall either abide the event
of the suit, or be paid by the party to whom such new trial is granted, 
according to the order of the court, to be made at the time of granting 
such new trial. ~ 
SEC. 3118. The court may determine not to grant a DC\\' trial, unless
certain terms or conditions named by the court shall be agreed to by the
opposite party; in the event of his agreement to which, the terms or
conditions named shall be entered on the recofd, and no new trial shall 
be granted if the party refuse to agree to the terms or conditions upon 
which a new trial shall be awarded. 
SEC. 3119. Upon any motion made for a new trial, or for judgment,
notwithstanding the verdict, by reason of the non-averment of some
material fact, the party whose pleading is thus alleged _<lefecti\�e, ma3r, if
the court deem it necessary, file a statement of the omitted fact, which,
if true, would remedy the alleged defects, and such statement shall be
filed bef ore the bearing of the motion, and shall suspend the same. If 
the facts thus stated would not, if proved, defeat the object of the motion, 
it shall be granted. If such new averments would, if proved, defeat the
object of the motion, and be not admitted, they must be denied or con�
fessed, and avoided by the opposite party, within such time as the court
shall direct, unless the same are denied by legal operation, and i11 such
case the law of pleading and of procedure, applicable to actions and
pleadings of that kind shall obtain ; except that the party stating the
new fact shall be held the plaintifff therein, and the statement nod re�
sponse shall not need to be verified." 
SEC. 3120. If the facts thus stated be admitted, or found to be true,
the party stating the same shall be entitled to such judgment as he would
have been entitled to, if such facts had been stated in the original plead� 
ing, and admitted as proved in the trial, together with the costs of, and
occasioned by the new pleading and the proceedings therein ; but if the 
fact be found untrue, the opposite party shall be entitled to his costs of, 
and occasioned by the new pleading and the proceedings therein, in ad� 
dition to any other costs to which he may be entitled. 
Judgment, 
SEC. 8121. Every final adjudication of the rights of the parties in
in action, is a judgment: and such adjudication may consist of many 
udgments, one of which judgments may determine for the plaintifff or 
lefendant on the claim of either as an entirety, or when a claim consists 
>f several parts or items, such judgment may be for either of them, on
lny specific part or item of such aggregate claim, and against him on 
.he other part thereof, or a judgment may in either of these ways
letermine on the claims of co-parties on the same side against each 
ither." 
SEO. 8122. To avoid a re-examination of questions and issues which
have been once satisfactorily settled, and a re-opening of such parts of a 
cause as have been satisfactorily tried, any party who succeeds in/art 
of his cause, or in part of his causes, and fails 8.3 to part, may hav the
entry in such case express judgment for him for such part as he succeeds
upon, and against him on the other part," 
SEC. 3123. Judgment may be rendered for or against one or more
of several plaintifffs, and for or against one or more of several defend�
ants, whether such plaintifffs or defendants be jointly or severally liable,
and the court may determine the ultimate rights of the parties, on the 
same side as between themselves, and may grant to any party any
affirmative relief which he may be entitled to, and render judgment
accordingly, and may render such and so many judgments, joint, sepa� 
rate, and. cross, as may be necessary to express the rights of the parties, 
SEC. 8124. Where matter in abatement is plead in connection with 
ither matter not such, the finding of the jury or court must distinguish

f it is rendered on the matter in abatement, and not on the merits, so
leclare. . 
SEC. 8125. Where any other than a general execution of the com�
non form is required, the party must state in his pleading the facts

with the finding of the court or jury thereon. 
SRc. 8126. In an action against several defendants, the court may, 
n its discretion, render judgment for or against one or more of them, 
whenever a several judgment is proper, leaving the action to proceed 
Lg&inst the others.

ing to the requirement of the court ;

ion must be upon the merits.

submission of the cause to the jury or to the court, when the trial is by

therefore, in favor of the party entitled thereto, and issue execution there�
for at the order of such party; the party so dismissing shall be liable
for no costs made by the other party after notice to him of such dis- 
missal. � 
SEC. 8132. Though all the defendants have been served with notice,
judgment may be rendered against any of them severally, where the 
plaintifff' would be entitled to judgments against such defendants, if the 
action had been against such alone.
SEc. 3133. The relief granted to the plaintifff, if there be no answer, 
can not exceed that which he shall have demanded in his petition. But 
in any other case the court may grant him any relief oonsistent with the
case made by the petition and embraced within the issue.

SEO. 8139. If a set-off, counterclaim or cross-demand established 
at the time, exceed the plaintifff's claim so established, judgment for the
defendant must be given for the excessr or if it appears that the defend� 
ant is entitled to any other affirmative relief, judgment m�1at then be giv� 
en therefore.

of the court and specify clearly the relief granted, or order made in the 
� 
action.

whether such sum is recovered by way of a debt or damages. 
SEC. 3145. The provisions of this chapter relative to juries are in� 
tended to be applied to the court when acting as a jury on the trial of a 
cause so far as they are applicable and not incompatible with other pro� 
visions herein contained.

ing to the circumstances.

CHAPTER 124. 
ATTACHllENT AND GARNISIDIENT. 
[Code Chapter 109.] 
SEC. 8172. (1846.) The plaintifff in a civil action may cause any 
property of the defendant which is not exempt from execution, to be 
attached at the commencement or during the progress of the proceeding, 
by pursuing the course hereinafter prescribed. 
SEc. 8173. (1847.) If it be subsequent to the commencement of 
� 
the action, a separate petition must be filed, and in all cases the proceed� 
ings relative to the attachment are to be deemed independent of the
ominary proceedings and only auxiliary thereto. 
SEC. 317 4. The petition which asks an attachment must, in all cases,
be sworn to. It must state: I. That the defendant is a foreign corpo� 
ration, or acting as�such ; or, 2. That he is a non-resident of the state ; 
or, 3. That he is in some manner about to dispose of or remove his
property out of the state, without leaving sufficient remaining for the
payment of hie debts ; or, 4. That he has disposed of his property (in
whole or in part) with intent to defraud his creditors; or, 6. 1"hat he 
has absconded, so that the ordinary process can not be served upon him ; 
or, 6. That he is about to remove permanently out of the county, and
has property therein not exempt from execution, with which he refuses 
to pay or to secure the debt due to the plaintifff residing in such oounty;
or, . 7. That he is about to remove permanently out of the state and
refuses to pay or secure the debt of the plaintifff. 
SEC. 8175. (1849.) If the plaintifff's demand is founded on con�
tract, the petition must state that something is due, and as nearly as 
practicable, the amount, which must be more than five dollars in order 
to authorize an attachment. 
SEc. 3176. (1850.) The amount thus sworn to is intended as a
guide to the sheriff, who must, as nearly as the circumstances of the
case will permit, levy upon property fifty per cent. greater in value than 
that amount. 
SEc. 3177. (1851.) If the demand is not founded on contract, the
original petition must be presented to some judge of the supreme or
district court, or the judge of the county court, who shall make an allow�
ance thereon of the amount in value of the property that � may be at� 
tached. The provisions of this section apply only to cases in the dis�
trict court. 
SEC. 8178. (1852.) The property of a debtor may be attached pre�
vious to the time when the debt becomes due, when nothing but time is 
wanting to fix an absolute indebtedness and when the petition in addi�
tion to that fact states : 1. That the defendant is about to dispose of his
property with intent to defraud his creditors ; or, 2. That he is about to
remove from the state, and refuses to make any arrangements for secur�
ing the payment of the debt when it falls due, and which contemplated
removal was not known to the plaintifff at the time the debt was con� 
tracted. 
SEC. 3179. If the debt or demand on which the attachment suit is 
brought, is not due at the time of the service of the attachment, the
defendant is not required to file any pleadings until the maturity of such

early as the cause is reached.

>f attachment, and direct restitution of any property taken under it, 
mless in a reasonable time, to be fixed by the co1irt, and within two
~ar days thereafter, sufficient security is given by the plaintifff: 
SEC. 8183. In an action on such bond the plaintifff therein may 
�ecover, if he shows that the attachment was wrongfully sued out, such
lamages as he hag thereby BUfFered, and if sued out maliciously as well 
lS wrongfully, the jury may, on such trial, give vindictive damages, in 
heir discretion, nor need be wait until the principal suit is determined 
>efore he bring suit on the bond.

SEc. 8189. Whenever it appears by the affidavit of the plaintifff, or
>y the return of the writ of attachment, that no property is known to 
he plaintifff, or the officer, on which the order of attachment can be

mt of the attachment, not exceeding double the amount of the plaintifff's

.um , but such owner or such firm may be garnished, and such property 
hereby reached. 
SEC. 3191. If the defendant at any time before judgment causes a
bond to be executed to the plaintifff by one or more sufficient sureties, to
be approved by the court, or by the judge, to the effect that the def end�

the supposed debtor or person holding the property, that he is attached
as garnishee, and by leaving with him a written notice to the effect that
he is required not to pay any debt due by him to the defendant, or
thereafter to become due, and that he must retain possession of all 
property of the said defendant then or thereafter being in his custody,
or under his control, in order that the same may be dealt with according
to law, and the sheriff shall summon such persons as garnishees, as the
plaintifff may direct. 
SEc. 8196. A sheriff or constable may be garnished for money of 
the defendant in his hands. So may a judgment-debtor of the def end�

liable to pay the entire judgment which the plaintifff eventually obtains
against the defendant. 
SEc. 8200. (1864.) The plaintifff may, in writing, direct the sheriff
to take the answer of the garnishee, and append the same to his re� 
turn. 
SEC. 8201. (1865.) In such ease the sheriff has power to admin�
ist~r an oath to garnishees, requiring them to make true answers to the
quest.ions to be propounded, which questions shall be as follows :

all the foregoing interrogatories, he shall be notified and required to
appear and answer on the first day of the next term of the district
court, or on the day fixed for trial, as above provided, and so he may be
required in any event, if the plaintifff so notify him. 
SEC. 8203. (1867.) The questions propounded to the garnishee in 
court, may be such as are above prescribed, to be asked by the sheriff,
and such others as the court may think proper and right .. 
SEC. 3204. (1868.) Where the garnishee is required to appear at
court, unless he has refused to answer, as contemplated above, he is
entitled to the pay and mileage of an ordinary witness, and may, in like 
manner, require payment before hand, in order to be made liable for
non-attendance. 
SEC. 3205. (1869.) If, when, duly summoned, and his fees ten�
dered, (when demanded.) he fail to nppear and answer the interroga�
tories propounded to him without sufficient excuse for his delinquency,
he shall be presumed to be indebted to the defendant to the full amount
of the plainriffs demand, and shall be dealt with accordingly. 
SEC. 3206. ( 1870.) But for a mere failure to appear, he is not
liable to pay the amount of the plaintifff 's judgment, until he has had
an� opportunity to show cause against the issuing of an execution. 
SEC. 3207. (1871.) A garnlshee may, at any time after answer,
exonerate himself from further responsibility, by paying over to the
sheriff the amount owing by him to the def cndant, nnd by placing at
the sheriff's disposal the property of the defendant, or so much of said
debts and property as is equal to the value of the property to be at� 
tached, all of which may afterwards be treated as though attached in
the usual manner. 
SEC. 3208. When the answer of the garnishee is made, whether at
the district court or before the justice, or before the sheriff, the plaintifff 
may controvert by pleading filed, any facts contained in the answer,
and specifically set out by the plaintifff, and issue being thereupon
ioined, may be tried in the usual manner, Upon such trial the answer 
of the garnishee is competent testimony. 
SEC. 8209. If in any of the above methods, it is made to appear
that the garnishee was indebted to the defendant, or had any of the 
Iefendant's property in his hands, either at the time of being served 
with the garnishee notice aforesaid, or at any time subsequent thereto,
he is liable to the plaintifff, in case judgment is finally recovered by 
him to the full amount of that judgment, or to the amount of such
indebtedness, and of the property so held by him, and a conditional
judgment shall be entered up against him accordingly, unless he prefers 
paying or delivering the same to the sheriff as above provided. 
SEC. 3210. If the debt of the garnishee to the defendant is not due,:
execution will be suspended until its maturity. 
SEC. 3211. The garnishee shall not be made liable on a debt due :

garnishee completely exonerated or indemnified from all liability thereon,
after he may have satisfied the judgment. 
SEC. 3212. The judgment in the garnishment suit, condemning the.
property or debt in the hands of the garnishee, to the satisfaction of the 
plaintifff 'a demand, is conclusive between the garnishee and defendant. 
SEC. 3213. The docketing of the original case shall contain a state� 
ment of all the garnishments therein, and when judgment is rendered 
against a garnishee, the same shall distinctly ref er to the original judg�
ment.

of the plaintifff, the defendant, the garnishee, or an intervenor claiming
the property or money. 
SEc. 3215. (187 4.) Property attached otherwise than by garnish� 
ment is bound thereby, from the time of the service of the attachment
only. 
SEO. 3216. The court before whom the action is pending, or the
judge thereof, in vacation may, at any time appoint a receiver to take

according to the nature of the property and eK.igency of the case. 
SEc. 8217. All money attached by the sheriff or coming into his
hands by virtue of the proceeding in attachment, shall forthwith be 
paid over to the clerk to be by him retained till the further action of
the court. 
SEC. 3218. The sheriff shall make such disposition of other attached
property as may be directed by the court or judge, and where there is 
no direction upon the subject, he shall safely keep the property, subject 
to the order of the court. 
SEC. 3219. The defendant, or any person in whose possession any 
attached property is found, or any person making affidavit that he has 
an interest in it, may, at any time before judgment, discharge the prop� 
ert.y attached, or any part thereof, by giving bond with security, to be
approved by the sheriff, in a penalty at least double the value of the 
property sought to be released, but if that sum would exceed three
times the claim, then in such sum as equals three times the claim, con� 
ditioned that such property, or its est.imated value, shall be delivered tc 
the sheriff to satisfy any judgment which may be obtained against tl1E 
defendant in that suit, within twenty days after the rendition thereof
This bond shall be filed with the clerk of the court. 
SEC. 3220. To determine the value of the property in cases where 
a bond is to be given, unless the parties agree otherwise, the sheriff shal
summon two disinterested persons having the qualification of jurors 
who, after being sworn by him to make the appraisement faithfully anc
impartially, shall proceed to the discharge of their duty, If such per 
sons disagree as to the value of the property, the sherifF shall decide
between them. 
SEC. 3221. (1879.) In an action brought upon the bond above con� 
templated, it shall be a sufficient defense that the property for the deliv� 
ery of which the bond was given, did not, at the time of the levy, belong
to the defendant against whom the attachment was issued. 
SEC. 8222. When the sheriff thinks the property attached in danger
of serious and immediate waste and decay, or when the plaintifff makes
affidavit to that effect, the sherifF may summon three persons having the
qualifications of jurors, to examine the same, The sheriff shall give
the def endant, if within the county, two clear days' notice of such hear�
ing, and he may appear before such jury and have a personal hearing.
If they are of the opinion that the property requires soon to be disposed 
of, they shall specify in writing, a day beyond which they do not deem
it prudent that it should be kept in the hands of the sheriff. If such
day occur before the trial day, he shall thereupon give the same notice
as for goods in execution, and for the same length of time, unless the
condition of the property renders a more immediate sale necessary. 
The sale shall be made accordingly. If the defendant gives his written
consent, such sale may be made without such finding of three men. 
SEC. 3228. The money arising from such sale shall remain in the
hands of the clerk to abide the event of the suit. 
SEc. 8224. The sheriff shall return upon every writ or attachment,
what he has done under it. The return must show the property at�
tached, the time it was attached, and the disposition made of it, by a
full and particular inventory; also, the appraisement above contemplated,
when such has been made. Where garnishees are summoned, their
names, and the time each was summoned, must be stated. And where
real property is attached, the sheriff shall describe it with sufficient cer� 
tainty to identify it, and where he can do so, by a reference to the book
and page where the deed under which the defendant holds is recorded. 
He shall return with the writ all bonds taken under it. Such return
must be made immediately after he shall have attached sufficient prop� 
erty, or all that he can find; or, at latest, on the first day of the term on 
which the defendant is notified to appear.

of his rights, where it satisfactorily appears by the petition, verified on
oath, or by affidavits or the proofs in the cause, that the plaintifff has a 
just claim, and that the property is about to be sold, concealed, or re�
moved from the state, or where the plaintifff states, on oath, that be has
reasonable cause to believe, and does believe, unless prevented by the
court, the property will be sold, concealed or removed from the state,

his oath, an attachment against the property may be granted. 
SEC. 8227. The attachments in the cases mentioned in the two last
sections, may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or
by the judge thereof, or the judge of the county court, upon such terms 
and conditions as to security on the part of the plaintifff, for the damages

erty against which it is issued, and shall have indorsed upon it the di�

a claim to the property or 1noney, or to an interest in, or lien on it,
under any other attachment, or otherwise, and setting forth the facts
upon which such claim is founded; and-the petitioner's claim shall be in
a summary manner investigated. The court may hear the proof or
order a reference, or may empannel a jury to inquire into the facts. If 
it is found that the petitioner has title to, a lien on, or any interest in
such property, the court shall make such order as n1ay be necessary to 
protect his rights. The costs of such proceedings shall be paid by either 
party, at the discretion of the court. 
SEC. 3238. The fact stated as a cause of attachment, shall not be 
contested in the action by a mere defense. The defendant's remedy
shall be on the bond, but lie may, in his discretion, sue thereon, by way
of counterclaim or cross-demand, and in such case, shall recover dam�
ages as in an original action on such bond. 
SEc. 32:39. A motion may be made to discharge the attachment, or 
any pnrt thereof, at any time before trial, for insufficiency of statement

of form, in the affidavit, bond, attachment, or other proceeding; and no 
attachment shall be dismissed for any defect in, or want of bond, if the
plaintifff, his agent or attorney, will at once substitute a sufficient bond,
but the statements of cause of attachment shall not be amended, nor

be the duty of the officer to subject the property of the other parties in
the order of their liability in the execution. But the party subsequently 
liable, shall, if requested by the officer, show property of the party liable
before him, 80 as to entitle himself to the benefit of this provision. 
SEC. 8261. But all the parties will be considered as equally liable in
all cases, unless the order of liability is shown to the court, and recited
in the judgment, and the clerk issuing execution on the judgment con�
taining such recital, shall state the order of liability in the execution. 
SEc .. 8262. When an execution is delivered to an officer, he must
proceed to execute the same with diligence ; if executed, an exact
description of the property, at length, with the date of the levy, shall be
indorsed upon or appended to the execftt.ion, and if tl1e writ was not 
executed, or only executed in part, the reason in such case must be
stated in the return. 
SEC. 8263. An execution may be issued and executed on Sunday,
whenever an affidavit shall be filed by the plaintifff or some person in

duties of the office in such case, may proceed thereon in the same man�
ner that the sheriff should have done. 
SEC. 3265. Upon the rendition of judgment, execution may be at
once issued, and shall be by the clerk, on the demand of the party enti�
tled thereto, and upon its issuance, the clerk shall enter on the judgment
docket the date of its issuance, and to what county and officer issued,
and shall also enter on said docket the return of the officer with the
date of the return, the dates and amount of all monies received into or
paid out of the office thereon, and these entries shall be made at the
time of the thing done. 
SEC. 3266. The clerk willfully neglecting or refusing to perform 
any one of the duties in this chapter imposed, shall be liable to� a pen� 
alty of five hundred dollars, and to damages to the party aggrieved
and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor in office, and on conviction thereof
shall be removed from office. 
Let,J. 
SEC. 8267. (1904.) The officer must execute the writ by levying
on the property of the judgment debtor, collecting the things in actior 
by suit in his O\\'n name, if necessary, or by selling the same, selling the 
other property and paying to the plaintifff the proceeds, or so much 
thereof as will satisfy the execution. 
SEC. 3268. The officer shall in all cases select such property, and iIJ 
. such quantities, as will be likely to bring the exact amount required tc 
be raised, as nearly as practicable, and having made one levy, may a1 
any time thereafter make other levies if he deem it necessary. 
SEC. 8269. Stock or interests owned by the defendant in any com� 
pany, and also debts due him, and property of his in the hands of third per�
sons, may be levied upon in the same manner provided for attaching the 
same. 
SEC. 3270. In proceedings by garnishment on execution, the gar�
nishee shall be served as in case of attachment; his answer may be 
taken by the officer in the same way and with the same results ; he 
may be notified to appear at the term of court in the same way, and
with the same results, and his default shall be attended with the same 
consequences. The plaintifff may also, if the garnishee is called into
court, have a case docketed against him without docket fee, and upon his 
answer to the officer, issue may be made and notice thereof given him,
or issue may be made on his answer in court without any notice thereon,
if made at the same term; and in all these and every other particular, 
the proceedings shall be the same as under garnishment on attachment,
as near as the nature of the case will allow. 
SEC. 8271. Proceedings by garnishment on � execution shall not be 
in any manner affected by the expiration of the execution or its return
and where parties thereunder have been garnished, the officer shall return
to the next term thereafter a copy of the execution with all his doings
thereon so far as the garnishments thereon are concerned. 
SEC. 8272. Bank bills and other things in action, may be Ieviec 
upon and sold, or appropriated as hereinafter provided, and assignments
thereon by the officer shall have the same effect as if made by the
defendant, and may be treated as so made. 
SEC. 8278. (1894.) After the rendition of judgment, any person
indebted to the defendant in execution, may pay to the sheriff the
amount of such indebtedness, or so much thereof as is necessary to sat�
isfy the execution, and the sheriff's receipt shall be a sufficient discharge 
therefore. 
SEC. 327 4. (1895.) Public buildings owned by the state, or any 
county, city, school district, or other civil corporation, and any other
public property which is necessary and proper for carrying out the gen�
eral purpose for which an)r such corporation "is organized, are exempt 
from execution. The property of a private citizen can in no case be
levied upon to pay the debt of a civil corporation. 
SEC. 3275. (1896. In case no property is found on which to levy,
which is not exempted by the last section, or if the judgment creditor
elect not to issue execution against such corporation, he is entitled to the 
unount of his judgment, and costs in the ordinary evidences of indebt�
edness issued by that corporation. And if the debtor corporation issues 
10 scrip or evidences of debt., a tax must be levied as early as practi�
eable, sufficient to pay off the judgment with interest and costs. 
SEC. 8276. (1897.) A failure on the part of the officers of the eor� 
ooration to comply with the requirements of the last section renders
hem personally responsible for the debt. 
SEo. 3277. If an officer who levies, or is required to levy an exe� 
mtion on personal property, doubts whether it is subject to the exeeu�
ion, he may give the plaintifff therein, or his agent or attorney, notice
~hat an indemnifying bond is required. Bond may, thereupon, be given, 
>y or for the plaintifff with one or more sufficient sueeties, to be approved 
>y the officer, to the effect that the obligors will indemnify him against
.he damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale 
>f the property, and will pay to any claimant thereof the damages he 
nay sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale, and will warrant to
my purchaser of the property, such estate or interest therein M is sold ;
md thereupon the officer shall proceed to subject \he property to the 
execution, and shall return the indemnifying bond to the district court
>f the county, in which the levy is made. 
SEC. 8278. If the bond mentioned in the last section is not given, 
.he officer may refuse to levy the execution, or if it has been levied and 
.he bond is not given in a reasonable time after it is required by the
>fficer, he may restore the property to the person from whose pos�
session it was taken, and the levy shall stand discharged. 
SEC. 3279. The claimant or purchaser of any property, for the seiz�
are Ol' sale of which an indemnifying bond has been taken and returned 
by the officer, shall be barred of any action against the officer levying
>n the property, if the surety on the bond was good when it was taken. 
A.ny such claimant or purchaser may maintain an action upon the bond,
snd recover such damages as he may be entitled to. 
SEC. 3280. Where property, for the sale of which the officer is
.ndemnifled, sells for more than enough to satisfy the execution under 
which it was taken, the surplus shall be paid into the court to which the
.ndemnlfying bond is directed to be returned. That court may order 
such disposition or payment of the money to be made temporarily or 
sbsolutely, as may be proper, in respect to the rights of the parties 
interested, � 
SEC. 8281. The sale of personal property on which an execution is
'evied, shall be suspended at the instance of any person other than the
lefendant in execution, claiming the property, who shall execute, with
me or more sureties, sufficient for double its value, a bond to the plain� 
:iff in the execution to the effect that, if it shall be adjudged that the
~roperty or any part of it is subject to the execution, be will pay to the 
plaintifff the value of the property so subject, and ten per cent. thereon,
rot exceeding the amount due on the execution and ten per cent. thereon. 
SEO. 3282. For the purpose of taking the bond mentioned in the
.ast section, the officer shall select three disinterested persons having the
1ualifications of jurors, and administer to them an oath, to make a fair
rppraisement of each article of the property, whose appraisement in 
writing shall be recited in the bond. The bond, with the appraisement
mnexed thereto, shall be returned to the district court of the county in 
which the levy was made, at the next term thereafter. 
SEO. 3283. The party to whom the bond is executed may move the 
eourt to which it is returned, for ajudgment thereon against all or any 
of the obligors, or their representatives, having given to them ten days'
notice of the motion. The court may cause such issues to be tried as it 
may prescribe, and direct which party shall be considered plaintifff in 
the issues. If the property or any part of it is found subject to the exe�
cution, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the plaintifff therein for
the value of the property so subject, and ten per cent. thereon, not
exceeding the amount due on the execution and� ten per cent. thereon.
An execution may be issued on the judgment forthwith, on which the 
sam'1ndorsement shall be made as on the execution in virtue of which
the property had been seized. 
SEC. 3284. Upon the trial of the motion, either party may object
that the property was not fairly appraised ; and thereupon the jury try� 
ing the facts shall hear evidence respecting, and find the value of the 
property. 
� SEO. 3285. The giving of the bond mentioned in section 8281 shall
not discharge the levy of the execution upon the property claimed.
But the officer may leave it, subject to the lien of the levy, with the
person in whose possession it is found, pending the proceeding on the
bond; and may, in the mean time, proceed with the execution against
other property of the. defendant. 
SEC. 3286. The provisions of the preceding sections of this chapter,
as to bonds, shall apply to proceedings upon executions, issued by justices 
of the peace. Indemnifying bonds shall be returned in such cases, with
the executions under which they are taken, and bonds of claimants of
property may be returned to the justice from whose office the execution
issued, and motion thereon shall be made before him on five days' notice. 
He shall cause a jury as in a civil cause, to be impanneled to find whether
the property was subject to the execution, and the judgment shall be
subject to an appeal. 
SEC. 8287. Whenever a sheriW or other officer shall levy an execu�
tion upon the property or effects held jointly or in partnership by the
debtor or debtors in execution, with others, to satisfy the separate debt
of such debtor or debtors, the sheriff or other officers shall not proceed
to make sale thereof, except as hereinafter provided, if the person or
persons, or any of them holding such joint or partnership interest with 
the debtor, shall assert an equitable or other claim thereto, and in writ� 
ing, notify the officer of the existence of such claim. 
SEC. 3288. � When a claim is asserted by the joint owners or part� 
ners to the property levied upon, the officer shall not, by virtue of his
levy, deprive the joint owners or partners of the possession of the prop� 
erty levied upon, except for the purpose of making an inventory thereof 
and having the same appraised. . 
SEC. 3289. The officer shall proceed to have the property levied
upon, appraised, as provided in section 3282, unless the value can be
agreed upon. He shall return the inventory and the appraisement with
the execution, to the office from which it issued, and in his return shall 
� state all the facts connected with the levy by him, and the claim set up
by the joint owner or owners. 
SEc. 3290. The execution creditor shall have a lien upon the prop�
erty levied upon, to the extent of his claim, if the same does not exceed
the interest of the judgment debtor in the property, and which shall con�
tinue until the levy is disposed 0� . 
SEC. 8291. Upon the execution being returned by the officer, that 
he had levied the same upon the property in which the debtor was joint
owner or partner, and that the same was claimed by the other joint 
owners or partners, the execution creditor may proceed in an action by 
equitable proceedings, to subject to the satisfaction of his execution, the
interest of the debtor so levied upon. 
SEc. 8292. If such creditor, at the commencement of his action, or
afterward, shall file an affidavit that he verily believes the property
levied upon will be removed from the county, or sold, or otherwise dis�
posed of, with intent fraudulently to defeat his lien, the court, or the 
judge thereof, in vacation, may make an order direc.tilg the officer to
possess himself of the property so levied upon, unless bond with app1'tved 
security shall be executed to the plaintifff in the execution, binding the
obligors in said bond to have the same forthcoming in obedience to any 
order or judgment of the court in the action, which bond shall be taken 
by the officer and returned by him to the court in which the action is 
pending. 
Stay of .Execution. 
SEC. 8293. When judgment has been rendered against any one for 
the recovery of money, he may, by procuring one or more sufficient
freehold securities to enter into a recognizance acknowledging themselves 
security for the defendant for the payment of the judgment, together 
with the interest and costs accrued and to accrue, have a stay of the
execution from the time of rendering judgment, as follows : 
If the sum for which judgment was rendered, inclusive of costs, does
not exceed five dollars, one month. 
If such sum and costs exceed five, but not twenty dollars, two
months.

months. 
If such sum and costs exceed one hundred, but not one hundred and 
fifty dollars, nine months. 
If such sum and costs exceed one hundred and fifty dollars, twelve
months. 
SEC. 3294. The provisions of the foregoing section� shall not be
enjoyed by any one who does not take such stay within ten days from
the expiration of the term at which judgment is rendered. No appeal 
shall be taken after such stay has been obtained, nor shall a stay be
taken on a judgment entered as herein contemplated, against one who .
is surety in the stay of execution, nor shall such stay be allowed to any 
judgment obtained by a laboring man or mechanic for his wages. 
SEc. 3295. The surety for stay of execution may be taken and
approved by the clerk, and the recognizance entered of record. The
undertaking in the recognizance shall be for the payment of the judg- .
ment, interest and costs, that may accrue at or before the expiration of
the term of the stay of execution. 
SEC. 8296. When the surety is entered after execution issued, the
clerk shall immediately notify the sheriff of the stay, and he shall forth�
with return the execution, with his doings thereon.

clerk to issue a joint execution against the property of all the judgment
debtors and sureties, describing them as debtors or sureties therein. 
SEC. 8300. When any court shall render judgment against two or 
niore persons, anjsof whom is surety for any other in the contract on
which the judgment is founded, there shall be no stay of execution
allowed, if the surety object thereto at the time of rendering the judg�
ment, whereupon it shall be ordered by the court that there be no stay,
unless the surety for the stay of execution will undertake specifically to 
pay the judgment, in case the amount thereof can not be levied of the 
principal defendant. 
SEC. 8301. Any surety for the stay of execution may file with the
clerk an affidavit, stating that he verily believes he will be liable for
the judgment, interest and costs thereon, unless execution issues imme� 
diately ; and the clerk shall thereupon issue execution forthwith, unless
other sufficient surety b~ entered before the clerk, as in other cases. 
SEC. 3302. If other sufficient suret.y be entered, it shall have the
force of the original surety entered before the filing of the affidavit, and
shall discharge the original surety. 
SEC. 3303. Where a stay of execution has been taken, such con�
fessed judgment shall not release any judgment � lien, by virtue of the 
original judgment for the amount then due. The officer holding the said
execution, shall return thereon what amount WM made from the princi� 
pal debtor, and how much from the surety.

where the last district court was held. In addition to which, in ease of 
the sale of real estate, or where personal property to the amount of two
hundred dollars or upwards is to be sold, there shall be two publications
of such notice, in some ne,vspaper printed in the county, if there be one. 
In constables' sales, there shall be no newspaper publication, and the

SEo.'3312. An officer selling without the notice above prescribed,

in the forenoon, and four o'clock in the afternoon, and the hour of the
commencement of the sale must be fixed in the notice.

is grossly inadequate, or when from any cause the sale is prevented from
taking place on the day fixed, the sheriff may postpone the sale for not
more than three days, without being required to give any farther not.ice
thereof; but he shall not make more than two such postponements, and
such postponement shall be publicly announced when the sale should
have taken place. 
SEC. 8315. When the property sells for more than the amount re�
quired to be collected, the overplus must be paid to the defendant, unless
the officer have another execution in his hands, on which said overplus 
may be rightfully applied. _ 
SEC. 3316. If the property levied on sell for less than sufficient for

ment as above authorized. 
SEC. 3321. When any pe~n has heretofore, or shall hereafter, pur�
chase at sheriff's sale, any real estate on which the judgment upon which
the execution issued was not a lien at the time of the levy, and which
fact was unknown to the purchaser, the .district court of the county shall
set aside such sale on motion, notice having been given to the debtor, as 
in case of action, and a new execution may be issued to enforce the
judgment, and upon tlie order being made to set aside the sale, the sheriff
or judgment-creditor shall pay over to the purchaser the purchase money; 
said motion may also be made by any person interested in the real 
estate. 
SEC. 3322. (1914.) Money levied upon may be appropriated with�
out being advertised or sold. The same may be done with bank bills,
drafts, promissory notes, or other papers of the like character, if the
plaintifff will receive them at their par value, as cash, or if the officer
can exchange them for cash at that value. 
SEC. 8823. When a judgment has been obtained against the execu� 
tor of one deceased, which the personal estate of the deceased is insuffi�
cient to satisfy, the plaintifff may file his petition in the office of the
clerk of the district court, wherein judgment was rendered against the 
executor, the heirs and divisees of .real estate (if there are such,) setting 
forth the facts, and that thve is real estate of the deceased within the
state, describing its location and extent, and praying the court to award
execution against the same. 
SEc. 8324. A notice shall thereupon be indorsed upon said petition,
notifying the persons against whom the petition is filed, to appear on the
fir~t day of the term, and show cause, if any they have, why execution 
should not be awarded. ..
SEC. 3325. The petition and notice shall be served and returned in 
the ordinary manner, and the same length of time shall be allowed for
appearance, as in civil actions. 
SEC. 3326. (1921.) At the proper time, the court shall award the
execution, unless sufficient cause be shown to the contrary. 
SEc�. 3327. (1922.) The non-age of the heirs or devisees shall not 
be deemed such sufficient cause � 
. 
SEC. 8328. (1923.) llutual judgments, the executions on which are 
n the hands of the same officer, may be set off, the one against the 
ther ; except that the costs shall be so set off, unless the balance of cash
.ctually collected on the larger judgment is sufficient to pay the costs 
~r both judgments, and such costs shall be paid therefrom accordingly. 
SEC. 332D. (In24.) When real property has been levied upon, if 
he estate is less than a lease-hold, having two years of an unexpired
erm, the sale is absolute. 
SEC. 3330. (1924.) When the estate is of a larger amount, the 
iroperty is redeemable, as hereinafter prescribed. 
SEC. 3331. (1925.) At the time of the sale, the sheriff shall give
o the purchaser a certificate containing a description of the property
md the amount of money paid by such purchaser ; and stating that un� 
ess redemption is made within one year thereafter, according to law, he
�r his heirs or assigns, will be entitled to a deed for the same. 
Redemption. 
SEC. 8332. (1926.) 'I'he defendant may redeem such property at 
my time within one year from the day of sale, as hereinafter pro� 
rided r and will, in the mean time, be entitled to the possession of the 
property. 
SEC. 8833. (1927.) For the first six months after such sale, his 
right to redeem is exclusive, but if no redemption is made by him at 
the end of that time, any creditor of the defendant, whose demand is 
:1 lien upon such real estate, may redeem the same at any time within 
nine months from the day of sale. But a mechanic's lien, before
iudgment thereon, is not of such a character as to entitle the holder 
to redeem. 
SEC. 8334:. (1928.) Any creditor whose claim becomes a lien prior 
to the expiration of the time allowed by law for the redemption by 
creditors, may redeem. A mortgagee may thus redeem before or after
the debt secured by the mortgage falls due. 
SEC. 8385. (1929.) Creditors having the right of redemption, may 
redeem from each other within the time above limited, and in the man� 
ner herein provided. 
SEc. 8336. (1930.) The terms of redemption in all cases, will be 
the reimbursement of the amount paid by the then holder, added to the
amount of his own lien, with interest upon the whole at the rate of ten 
per cent. per annum, together with costs, subject to the exception con�
tained in the next section. But where a mortgagee, whose claim is not
yet due, is the person from whom the redemption is thus to be made, a
rebate of interest, at the rate of ten per cen� per annum, must be made 
by such mortgagee on his claim. 
SEc. 8337. (1931.) When a senior creditor thus redeems from his 
junior, he is required to pay off only the amount of those liens which
are paramount to his own, with the interest and costs appertaining to 
those liens. 
SEC. 3338. (1932.) But the junior creditor may in all such cases
prevent a redemption by the holder of �the paramount lien, by paying
off that lien, or by leaving with the clerk before hand the amount nec� 
essary therefore. 
SEC. 8339. A junior judgment creditor may redeem from a senior
judgment creditor, by paying to the party, the clerk or the sheriff, if 
execution has issued, the full sum due, with interest and costs, and 
shall become thereby vested with the title to the judgment so redeemed. 
SEC. 8340. If paid to the sheriff, he shall give to the party redeem�
ing, a certificate that he has paid such sum for the redemption of the 
judgment, describing it, which being presented to the clerk, he shall 
enter such redemption on the judgment docket, as he shall also do if
the money is paid to himself. 
SEO. 8341. (1988.) Whenever a senior creditor redeems from a
junior creditor, the latter may in return, redeem from the former, and 
so on, as often as the land is taken from him by virtue of a paramount
lien. 
SEc. 3342. (1934.) After the expiration of nine months from the
day of sale, the creditors can no longer redeem from each other, except 
as hereinafter provided. But the defendant may still redeem at any
time before the end of the year, as aforesaid. 
SEC. 3343. (1985.) Unless the defendant thus redeems, the pur�
chaser, or the creditor, who last redeemed, prior to the expiration of the
nine months aforesaid, will hold the property absolutely. 
SEO. 8844. (1986.) In case it is thus held by a redeeming cred�
itor, his lien, and the- claim out of which it arose, will be held to be
extinguished, unless he pursues the course pointed out in the next 
� 
section. 
SEO. 3845. If he is unwilling to hold the property and credit the
defendant therefore, with the full amount of his lien, he must, within ten 
days after the nine months aforesaid, enter on the sale book the utmost
amount that he is thus willing to credit on his claim. 
SEC. 3346. ( 1938.) Any unsatisfied lien creditor, within ten days
after the expiration of the time thus allowed to make the entry re�
quired in the last section, may redeem the property by paying the
amount of the legal disbursements of the last holder, as hereinbefore 
regulated, added to the amount thus entered on the sale book, together
with interests and costs. 
SEc. 3347. (1939.) Such redemptioner shall also credit the defend�
ant with the full amount of his lien, unless within ten days after re�
deeming as aforesaid, he likewise makes a like entry on the sale book,
in which case any unsatisfied lien creditor, may in like manner redeem
within ten days as aforesaid, and so on until there are no more unsat�
isfied liens, or until the expiration of the year for redemption, the
defendant having the final privilege of redeeming from the Wt redemp�
tion at the end of the year. 
SEO. 3348. (1940.) The mode of making the redemption is by
paying the � money into the clerk's office for the use of the persons 
thereto entitled. The person so redeeming, if not defendant in execu�
tion, must also file his affidavit, or that of his agent or attorney, 
stating as nearly as practicable, the amount still unpaid and due on his 
own claim. � �
SEc. 3349. (1941.) The clerk shall thereupon give him a receipt 
for the money, stating the purpose for which it was paid. He must
also, at the same time, enter in the sale book a minute of such redemp�
tion, of the amount paid, and the amount of the lien of the Wt redemp�
tion, as sworn to by him. 
Ssc, 3350. (1942.) A creditor redeeming as above contemplated,
is entitled to receive an assignment of the certificate issued by the sher� 
iff, to the original purchaser, as hereinbefore directed. 
SEC. 3!351. (194:3.) When the property has been sold in parcels,
any distinct portion may be redeemed by itseU: 
814~0. 3352. (1944.) When the interests of several tenants in com�
mon, have been sold on execution, the undivided portion of any or
either of them may be redeemed separately. 
SEo. 8858. (1945.) The rights of a defendant in relation to re�
lemption, are traosf errable, and the assignee has the like power .t4 
redeem, � 
SEc. 8854. (1946.) If the defendant or his assignee fail to redeem, 
the sheriff must, at the end of the year, execute a deed to the per80D
who is entitled to the eertift<Bte as hereinbefore provided, or to his 
sssignee. If the person entitled be dead, the deed shall be made to his
heirs, but the property will be subject to the payment of the debts of 
the deceased, in the same manner, as if acquired during his lifetime. 
SEC. 3355. {1947.) The purchaser of real estate at a sale on exe� 
eution, need not place any evidence of bis purchase upon record, until 
Lwenty days after the expiration of the full time of redemption. Up to 
that time the publicity of the proceedings is constructive notice of the
rights of the purchaser, but no longer. 
SEO. 3356. (19j8.) Deeds executed by a shemf in pursuance of
such sales, are presamptive evidence of the regularity of all previous
proceedings, in the case, and may be given in evidence without prelim�
inary proof. 
SEC. 3357. (1949.) When real estate has been sold on execution, 
the purchaser thereof, or any person who has succeeded to his interest, 
may, after his estate becomes absolute, recover damages for any injury 
to the property committed after the sale and before posses&ion is deliv� 
ered under the conveyance. 
SEc. 3358. (1951.) The term "defendant" as herein used, ie in�
tended to designate the party against whom, and the term " plaintifff"
the party in favor of whom, any execution has issued. 
SEc. 3859. (1952.) The provisions of this chapter are intended to 
embrace proceedings in justices' courts, so far as they are applicable ;
and the terms " sheriff,'' and " clerk," are accordingly to be understood,
as qualified in this chapter, in the same manner, in this respect, as in 
that relative to attachment.

such surrender, until it shall be done, or the court is satisfied that it is 
out of his power to do so. � 
SEC. 8396. The use of the appliances of this equitable action is no 
waiver of the use of the remedy of the chapter next preceding. Nor 
is the use of the appliances of that chapter a waiver of the right to also 
use the appliances of this, but any party entitled to one may use either 
or both as he may deem it desirable �

thereof, upon its being rendered probable, by affidavit or petition sworn
to, or by exhibition of the record, that the party is entitled to have 
such judgment or order vacated or modulecL

SEo. 8507. The appeal shall not be taken, except within one year 
from the rendition of the judgment or order, unless the party taking the
same was an infant, married woman, or of unsound mind, at the time of 
its rendition; in which cases, such parties or their legal representatives 
may take an appeal within one year after the removal of their disability
or death, whichever may first happen. 
SEC. 8508. The cause shall be docketed as it was in the court below,
and the party taking the appeal shall be called the appellant, and the
other party the appellee, . 
SEC. 8509. An appeal is taken by the service of a notice, in writing,
on the adverse party, his agent, or any attorney, who appeared for him 
in the case in the district court, and also upon the clerk of the court
wherein the proceedings were had, stating the appeal from the same, or 
or from some specific part thereof, defining such part.
SEc. 8510. An appeal from part of an order, or from one of the 
judgments of a final adjudication, or from part of a judgment, shall not
disturb or delay the rights of any party to any judgment or part of a
judgment, or order not appealed from; but the same shall proceed, as if 
no such appeal had been taken. 
SEC. 3511. An appeal shall not be perfected until the notice thereof 
has been served upon both the party and the clerk, and the clerk paid
or secured, (unless already secured.) his fees for a transcript; where�
upon the clerk shall forthwith transmit by mail, express, or a safe and
less expensive messenger, not a party, nor the attorney of a party, a
transcript of the record in the cause, or of so much thereof as the
appellant in writing in the notice has directed, to which shall be ap�
pended copies of the notices of appeal, and of the supersedeas bond, if 
any. 
SEO. 3512. In an action by ordinary proceedings, and in an action 
by equitable proceedings, tried by the second method of trying equitable
actions, all proper entries made by the clerk, and all papers pertaining
to the cause, and filed therein, ( except subpoenas, depositions, and other
papers which are used as mere evidence,) are to be deemed part of the
record. Bot in an action by equitable proceedings tried by the first
method of trying equitable actions, the depositions and all papers which
were used as evidence, are to be certified up to the supreme court, and
shall be so certified, not by transcript, but in the original form. But a
transcript of a motion, affidavit, or other paper, when it relates to a col�
lateral matter, shall not be certified, unless by direction of the appel� 
lant. If so certified, when not material to the determination of the
appeal, the court may direct the person blameable theref or to pay the
costs thereof. 
SEc. 3513. The notices of appeal must be served fifteen days 
before the first day of the next term of the supreme court, or the same
shall not then be tried, unless the appellee shall give the appellant, ten 
days before the term, notice indicating that he will insist on a bearing at
such term, in which event the cause shall be heard at such term, unless 
the appellant shall, on a sufficient showing, obtain a continuance. 
Sao. 8514. If the appellant having taken an appeal fifteen days
before the term, fails to file a transcript in the supreme court, on the
morning of the first day of that part of the term devoted to causes from
the district whence comes the appeal, or if not taken as many as fifteen 
days before the term, he fail to have the case so filed at the next suc�
ceeding term on the morning aforesaid, in either event, unless the
appellant file at the time, when such transcript should be filed, the cer�
tificate of the clerk stating when �he was served with notice, and that
he has not had sufficient time to prepare a transcript, the appellee may
file a transcript of the judgment, and of the notice served on the clerk,
and may, on motion, have the appeal dismissed, or the judgment
affirmed. 
SEC. 8515. If the transcript has been sent up, but the appellant does
not file the same, when the .same should be filed as herein provided, the 
appellee may file the same, and may, ori motion, have the appeal dis�
missed, or the judgment affirmed, as the court from the circumstances of 
the case shall . determine. 
SEc. 3516. H, the transcript being filed, errors are not assigned by 
the morning of the first of those days devoted to causes from the dis�
trict whence comes the appeal, the appellee may, on motion, have the
appeal dismissed, or the judgment or order affirmed, unless a good cause
for the failure is shown by affidavit. ~ 
SEC. 8517. (1979.) A part of several co-parties may appeal, but in
such case they must serve notice of the appeal upon all the other co�
parties, and file the proof thereof with the clerk of the supreme court. 
SEC. 3518. If the other co-parties refuse to join, they can not nor
can any of them take an appeal afterwards ; nor shall they derive any 
benefit from the appeal, unless from the necessity of the case. 
SEC. 8519. Unless they appear and decline to join, they shall be
deemed to have joined, and shall be liable for their due proportion of
costs. 
SEc. 3520. The death of one or all of the parties shall not cause
the proceedings to abate, but the names of the proper persons shall be
substituted, as is provided in such CASes in the district court, and the
cause may proceed. The court may also, in such case grant a continu�
ance, when such a course will be calculated to promote the ends of jus� 
tice. 
SEC. 3521. Where appellant has no right, or no further right to 
prosecute the appeal, the appellee may move to dismiss the appeal, and
if the grounds of the motion do not appear in the record, or by a writ� 
ing, purporting to have been singed by the appellant, and filed, they
must be verified by affidavit. 
SEc. 3522. The appellee may by answer filed and verified by him�
self, agent or attorney, plead any facts which render the taking of the
appeal improper, or destroy the appellant's right of further prosecuting
the same, to which answer the appellant may file a reply, likewise veri�
fied by himself, his agent or attorney, and the questions of law or fact
therein shall be determined by the court. 
SEC. 3523. The service of all notices of appeal, or in any way grow� 
ing out of such right,or eonnected therewith,and all notices in thesupreme
court, shall be in the way provided for the service of like notices in the
district court, and they may be served by the same person and returned
in the same manner, and the original notice of appeal must be returned,
immediately after service, to the office of the clerk of the district court
where the suit is pending. 
SEC. 8524. It shall be the duty C1f the appellant to file a perfect
transcript, and to that end the clerk of the district court must at any 
time on his suggestion of the diminution of the record, and on the pay� 
ment of fees, certify up any omitted part of the record, according to the 
troth, as. the same appears in his office of record ; and such applicant
shall not be entit1ed to any continuance, in order to correct the record,
unless it shall clearly appear to the court that he is not in fault, Sub� 
ject to which requirement, either party may, on motion before trial day, 
obtain an order on the clerk .of the district court, commanding him to 
transmit at once to the supreme court, a true copy o{ such imperfect or 
omitted part of the record, as shall be in general terms described in the 
affidavit or order. Such motion must be supported by affidavit, unless
the diminution be apparent or admitted by the adverse party, and must
not be granted unless the court is satisfied taat it is not made for delay. 
SEC. 8525. Where a view of an original paper in the action may be 
important to a correct decision of the appeal, the court may order the
clerk of the district court to transmit the same, which he shall do in
some safe mode, to the clerk of the supreme court, who shall hold the
same subject to the control of the court. 
SEC. 8526. The appellant may be required to give security for costs,
under the same circumstances as those in which plaintifffs in civil actions
in ..the district court, 'may be so required. 
SEc. 3527. An appeal shall not stay proceedings on the judgment 
or order, or any part thereof, unless a eupersedeas is issued, and no ap�
peal or supersedeas shall vacate or affect the lien of the judgment apc�
pealed from. 
SEC. 8528. A snpersedeas shall not be Issued until the appellant
shall cause to be executed before the clerk of the court which rendered
the judgment or order, by one or more sufficient sureties, to be approved 
by such clerk, a bond to the effect that the appellant shall pay to the 
appellee all costs and damages that shall be adjudged against the appel�
lant on the appeal ; also that he will satisfy and perform the judgment
or order appealed from, in case it shall be affirmed, and any judgment
or order which the supreme court may render, or order to be rendered, 
by the inferior court, not exceeding in amount or value the original judg�
ment or order, and all rents, or hire, or damages to property during the 
pende.ncy of the appeal, out of the possession of which the appellee i$ 
kept by reason of the appeal. If the bond is intended to stay proceed� 
ings, on only a part of the judgment or order, it shall be varied so as to 
secure the part superseded alone. When such bond has been approved 
by the clerk, and filed, he shall issue a written order commanding the 
appellee and all others, to stay proceedings on such judgment or order,
or on such part as is superseded as the case may be. 
SEC. 8529. If the appellee believe the supersedeas bond defective,
or the sureties insufficient, he may move the supreme court, if in session 
or in its vacation, on ten days' written notice to the appellant, may move 
any judge of said court, or the judge of the district court where the a~
peal was taken, to discharge the supersedeas, and if the court, or such
judge, shall consider the sureties insufficient, or the bond substantially 
defective in securing the rights of the appellee, ihe court or such judge,
shall issue an order discharging the supersedeas, unless a good bond,
with sufficient sureties, be executed by a day by him fixed. 'fhe order, 
if made by a judge, shall be in writing, and signed by him, and upon its 
filing, or the filing of a certified copy of the order when made in court,
in the office of the clerk of the district court, execution and other pro- 
eeedings for enforcing the judgment or order may be taken, if a new and
good bond is not filed and approved by the day fixed as aforesaid. 
SEC. 3530. But another supersedeas may be issued by the clerk,
upon the execution before him, of a new and lawful bond with sufficient
sureties, as hereinbef ore provided. � 
SEc. 3531. It the judgment or order is for the payment of money,
the penalty shall be in at least twice the amount of the judgment and
costs. If not for the payment of money, the penalty shall be sufficient 
to save the appellce harmless from the consequences of taking the ap�
peal But it shall in no case be less than one hundred dollars. 
SEC. 3532. Th4e taking of the appeal from a part of a judgment or
order, and the filing of a bond as above directed, does not cause a stay
of execution as to any part of the judgment or order not appealed 
from. � 
SEC. 3538. (1987.) If execution has issued prior to giving the bond
above contemplated, the clerk shall countermand the same. 
SEC. 3534. (1988.) Property levied upon and not sold at the time
such countermand is received by the sheriff, sball forthwith be delivered 
up to the judgment debtor. 
. 
SEC. 8535. The clerk shall arrange the appeals upon the docket,
setting a proper number for each day of the term, and placing together 
those from the same judicial district � 
� SEC. 3536. The supreme court may reverse or affirm the judgment
or order below, or the part of either appealed from, or may render such 
judgment or order as the district court or judge should have done, ac�
cording as it may think proper. 
� SEc. 3587. (1986.) The supreme court, where it affirms the judg�
ment, shall also, if the appellee moves therefore, render judgment against 
the appellant and his sureties on the bond above mentioned, for the
amount of the judgment, damages and costs referred to therein, in case
such damages can be accurately known to the court without an issue and 
ti-iit.l. . 
SEC. 3538. Upon the affirmance of any judgment or order for the
payment of money, the collection of which, in whole or part, has been
superseded by bond, as above contemplated, the court shall award to the
appellee damages upon the amount superseded ; and if satisfied by the
record, that the appeal was taken for delay only, must award such sum
as damages, not exceeding fifteen per cent. thereon, as shall effectually
tend to prevent the taking of appeals for delay only. 
SEC. 3539. If the supreme court affirm the judgment or order, it 
may send the cause to the district court to have the same carried into
effect, or it may itself issue the necessary process for this purpose, and
direct such process to the sheriff of the proper county, according as the 
party thereto may require.
SEc. 3540. {1992.) If by the decision of the supreme court, the 
appellant becomes entitled to a restoration of any pnrt of the money
or property that was itlken from him by means of such judgment or
order, either the supreme or district court may direct execution or writ
of restitution to issue for the purpose of restoring to such appellant his
property or value thereof

under a judgment subsequently reversed, shall not be affected by such 
reversal.

dates upon inferior courts and officers, by fine and imprisonment, which 
imprisonment may be continued until obeyed. 
SEC. 8543. If a petition for re-bearing be filed, the same shall sus� 
pend the decision or procedendo, if the court, on its presentation, or one 
of the judges, if in vacation, shall so order, in either' of which cases 
such decision and procedendo shall be suspended until the next term. 
SEC. 8544. The petition for re-hearing shall be the argument of the 
applicant therefore, and if the court think that such argument requires a
reply, it shall so indicate to the other party, and he maJ make reply within
such time as said court shall allow, and with a view to a re-hearing, t-he 
court may extend the suspension of proceedings yet farther, if need be. 
SEc. 3545. A judgment or order shall not be reversed for an error 
which can be corrected, on motion, in the inferior court, until such mo� 
tion has been made there and overruled. 
SEC. 3546. An assignment of error need follow no stated form, bot 
must, in a way, as specific as the case will allow, point out the very error 
objected to. Among several points in a demurrer, or in a motion, or 
instructions, or rulings in an exception, it must designate which is relied
on as an error, and the court will only regard errors which are aseigned
with the required exactness ; but the court must decide on each error 
assigned. ~ 
SEC. 3547. All motions must be entered in the motion book, and
shall stand over till the next morning after that morning on which en� 
tered, and till after having been publicly called by the court, unless the
parties otherwise agree, and the adverse party shall be deemed to have 
notice of such motion.

effect, such decision, and the order of the court thereon, being certified 
thereto and entered on the records of that court, shall have the same
force and effect as if made and entered during the session of the court 
in that district. 
SEC. 8552. Executions issued from the supreme court shall be the 
same as those from the district court, and attended with the same con�
sequences, and shall be returnable in the same time. 
(Code-Chapter 115.]

such process. �
6. The facts constituting the alleged cause of detention thereof; ac� 
cording to his best belief.

the value of the property sought, conditioned that he will appear at the 
next term of the court, and prosecute his suit to judgment, and return
the property, if a return be awarded, and also pay all costs and dam .. 
ages that ~ay be adjudged against him. This bond shall be filed with
the clerk of the court, and is for the use of any person injured by the 
proceeding, and a judgment for money rendered against the plaintifff shall 
go against the sureties on the bond.� 
SEC. 8555. (1997.) The clerk shall thereupon issue a writ of re�
plevin directed to the sheriff to take the property therein described and
deliver the same to the plaintifff. The ordinary original notice must
also be served on the defendant in the usual manner. . 
SEc. 8556. When any of the property is removed� to another oounty 
after the commencement of the action, counterparts of the writ of
replevin may issue on the demand of the plaintifff, to such other county,
and may be executed upon such goods found in such county, and farther 
writs of replevin and the necessary counterparts thereof may issue as
often as may be necessary. 
SEO. 8557. The sheriff must forthwith execute the writ by taking 
possession of the property therein mentioned, if it is found in the pos�
session of the defendant, or of his agent, or of any other person who

after the writ was placed in the sheriff's hands, for which purpose he 
may break open any dwelling house or other enclosure, having first
demanded entrance and exhibited his authority, if required. 
SEC. 3558. When it appears by affidavit that the property claimed
has been disposed of or concealed, so that the writ can not be executed, 
the court may compel the attendance of the defendant, and examine 
him on oath as to the situation of the property, and punish a willful 
obstruction or hindrance of the writ, and a disobedience of the order of 
the court in this respect, as in case of contempt. 
SEC. 3559. The sheriff must return the writ on or before the first 
day of the trial term, and shall state fully what he has done thereunder. 
If he has taken any property he shall describe particularly the same.

SEC. 3562. The judgment shall determine which party is entitled 
to the possession of th~ property, and shall designate his right therein,
and if such party have not the possession thereof, shall also determine 
the value of the right of such party, which right shall be absolute as to 
an adverse party having no right in such property, and shall also award
such damages to either party as he may be entitled to, for illegal deten� 
tion of such property." 
� 
SEC. 3563. The party entitled thereto, may have execution for the 
money found due him, or may, in his discretion, have execution for the 
delivery of the property, and if the property, or any article thereof, can
not be obtained on execution, he may have execution for the value of
such article. t � 
SEC. 3564. When it appears by the return of the officer, or by the
affidavit of the plaintifff, that any specific property which has been
adjudged to belong to one party, has been concealed or removed by the
other, the court, or a judge may require him to attend and be examined 
on oath, respecting such matter, and may enforce its order in tliIB respect
as in cases of contempt. 
SECTION 3565. An action may be had in which the plaintifff may
claim the delivery of personal property to be made after judgment, or
the value thereof, in his discretion, if the specific property can not then 
be obtained.

requirements of sub-divisions one, two, three, four, five and six, of sec�
tion 3553 of the chapter on replevin.

title, if he establishes the same, and shall also declare the value of such 
right, as in replevin.

the facts constituting the right, that the plaintifff is entitled to the pos�
session of the premises, particularly describing them, also the quantity 
of his estate and the extent of his interest therein, and that the defend�
ant unlawfully keeps him out of possession, and the damages, if any,
which he claims for withholding the property ; but if he claims other
damages than rents and profits, he shall state the facts constituting the
cause thereof." 
SEC. 3571. -w-henever it appears that the defendant is only a tenant,
the landlord may be substituted, notice thereof being given him, as in an 
original action. 
SEC. 3572. When the defendant is a non-resident, having an agent
of record for the property in the state, service may be made upon such
agent in the same manner and with the like effect as though made on the
principal. 
SEC. 3578. The answer of the defendant and of each, if more than
one, must set forth what part of the land he claims, and what interest he

if as mere tenant, the name and residence of his landlord, and need state
nothing more than this.

this nature, for reasons of less importance than those required to be set

necessary to prove him in possession of the premises. 
SEC. 3576. (2008.) The plaintifff can not recover for the use and

defendants, the court may order a discontinuance as to them before the
testimony in the case is closed. 
_SEC. 8581. Where there are two or more plaintifffs or defendants, 
any one or more plaintifffs may reoover against one or more of the de�
fendants, the premises or any part thereof or any interest therein, or
damages according to the rights of the parties ; but the recovery shall
not be for a greater interest than that claimed. 
SEC. 8582. (2012.) Judgments in proceedings of this nature are as
oonclusive as those in actions relating to personal property, except as 
herein otherwise provided. 
SEC. 3588. (2013.) The preceding section is intended to apply only
to interests existing at the time of the trial, and is not intended to pre� 
vent a new action to test the validity of rights acquired subsequently to 
the former trial. 
SEO. 8584. (2014.) The court in its discretion may grant a new
trial on the application of a party or those claiming under him, made
at any time within two years after the determination of the former

of the term at which the judgment was rendered, the party obtaining a
new trial shall give the opposite part.y ten days notice thereof before the
term at which the action stands for trial. 
SEC. 8586. (2015.) The result of such new trial if granted after
the close of the term at which the first trial took place, shall in no case
affect the interest of third persons, acquired in good faith for a valuable
consideration, since the former trial. 
SEC. 3587 (2016.) But the party who, on such new trial, shows
himself entitled to lands which have thus passed to a bona-fide pur�
chaser, may recover the proper amount of damages against the other 
party either in the same or a subsequent action.

his own title. 
� SEC. 3592. The court, on motion, and after notice to the opposite

peciftcations, entitles the plaintifff to the qu8Dtity of interest or estate, 
11 the premises as set forth and described in the petition.

nade thereon to the extent of the damages, unless he prefers to avail
iimself of the law for the benefit of occupying claimant&.

SECTION 8761. The writ of mandamus is an order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction, and issues from the district court commanding
an inf erior tribunal, corporation, board or peff on, to do or not to do, an
act, the performance or omission of which the law specially enjoins as 
a duty, resulting from an office, trust or station, and it is granted on the
petition of any private pnrty aggrieved, without the concurrence of the 
prosecutor for the state, or on the petition of the state by the district
attorney, when the public interest is concerned, and is in the name of 
such private party, or of the state, as the case may be in fact brought. 
SEC. 37 62. The plaintifff in such action shall state his claim, and
shall also state facts sufficient to constitute a cause for such claim, and
shall also set forth that the plaintifff, if a private individual, is personally 
interested therein, and that lie sustains and may sustain damage by the
non-performance of such duty, and that performance thereof has been 
demanded by him; and ref used or neglected, and 8hn11 pray a writ of
mandamus commanding the defendant to fulfill such duty. 
SEC. 37 63. Where a discretion is left to an inferior tribunal, the
writ of mandamus can only compel it to act. It can not control the dis� 
cretion of the inferior tribunal. 
SEc. 8764. The writ may also be issued by the supreme court to 
any district court, if necessary, and also in any other case where it is 
found neces~ary, to enable it to exercise its legitimate power.

142, 143 and 144 hereof, may also in aid of such cause of action, pray, 
and have a writ of mandamus to compel the performance of a duty
established in such action. But if such duty, the performance of which 
is sought to be compelled, is not one .resulting from an office, trust, or
station, it must be one for t.he breach of which a legal right to damages 
is already complete at the commencement of the action, and must also
be a duty of which a court of equity would enforce the performance." 
I 
SEc. 3768. In case judgment be given to the plaintifff that a man�
damus do issue, it shall be lawful for the court in which such judgment 
is given, if it shall see fit, besides issuing execution in the ordinary way

t>ther person appointed by the court, at the expense of the defendant,
wd upon the act being done, the amount of such expense may be aseer� 
tained by the court, or by a reference appointed by the court, as the
court or judge may order, and the court may render judgment for the
amount of such expeases and costs, and enforce paym.ent thereof bJ

SEC. 877 4. (2190.) When it is a mere auxiliary measure resorted 
to during the trial of the principal cause, the terms on which it is allowed
as well as the kind of notice to be given to the opposite party, shall be 
such as the court prescribes. 
SEC. 8775. (2191.) \Vhen applied for as an independent means oj 
relief, the petition must be sworn to and presented to the district court

ceedings are pending. The bond must also in that case be farther con� 
ditioned to pay any judgment that may be ultimately recovered against 
the party who seeks the injunction, for the cause of action on which the
suit sought to be enjoined is founded.

defendant to show cause, he may at any time before the next term of the
court apply to the- judge who made the order to vacate or modify the 
same. 
SEO. 8788. (2199.) Such application must be with notice to the
plaintifff and may rest upon the ground that the order was improperly
granted, or it may be founded upon affidavits on the part of the defend�
ant. In the latter case the plaintifff may fortify his application by counter
affidavits and have reasonable time therefore. 
SEO. 3784. (2200.) The judge may thereupon decide the matter at 
once, unless some good cause for delay be shown. But the vacation of
the order shall not prevent the cause from proceeding if any thing be 
left to proceed upon. 
SEO. 3785. (2201.) Any judge of the supreme or district court,
being furnished with an authenticated copy of the writ of injunction,
and also with satisfactory proof that such injunction has been violated,
shall issue his precept to the sheriff of the county where the violation of 
the injunction occurred, or to any other sheriff, (naming him,) more con�
venient to all parties concerned, directing him to attach said defendant
and bring him forthwith before the same or some other judge, at a place 
to be stated in said precept, 
SEC. 8786. (2202.) If, when thus produced, he files his affidavit
denying or sufficiently excusing the contempt charged, he shall be re�
leased and the affidavit shall be filed with the clerk of the court for pres�
ervation. 
SEC. 3J87. (2203.) But if he failed to do so, the judge may require
him to give bond, with surety, for his appearance at the next term of

mitted to the jail of the county where the proceedings are pending,
until the next term of the court. 
SEC. 3789. (2205.) If the security be given, the court at the next
term shall act upon the case, and punish the contempt in the usual 
mode. 
SEC. 3790. (2206.) The defendant may move to dissolve the injunc�
tion, either before or after the filing of the answer.

the whole case, shall be allowed. � 
SEC. 8794. Upon the dissolution, in whole or in part, of an injunc�
tion to stay proceedings upon a judgment or final order, the damages
shall be assessed by the court, which may hear the evidence and decide
in a summary way, or may, on the request of either party, cause a jury 
to be empanneled to find the damages. Where money is enjoined, the
damages may be any rate per cent. on the amount released by the dis�
solution, which, in the discretion of the court, may be proper, not exceed� 
ing ten per cent. And where the delivery of property has been delayed 
by the injunction, the value of the use, hire, or rent thereof shall be 
assessed. Judgment shall be rendered against the party who obtained
the injunction, for the damages assessed, and against the surety of such 
party. 
SEC. 3795. (2210.) For good cause shown, a judge's order may 
issue in vacation, directing any of the officers of the court in relation to 
the discharge of their duties.

vacation in which it is granted, and for the first two days of the ensuing 
term.

such requirement would be clearly unnecessary and improper.

for the failure to do so. 
� 
SEc. 8802. (2214.) This petition must be sworn to by the person
confined or by some one in his behalf, and presented to some court or
officer authorized to allow the writ. 
SEc. 3803. (2215.) The writ of habeas corpus may be allowed by 
the supreme or district court, or by any judge of either of those courts. 
In such cases it may be served in any part of the state. 
SEC. 3804. (2216.) It may also be allowed by any county court
except when the commitment was made by order of one of the courts
or officers mentioned in the last section, but when allowed by the
county court it is valid onJy within the limits of the county where

SEc. 3805. (2217.) Application for this writ, when made to the
supreme or district courts or judges thereof, must be made to the court

the application to the more convenient supreme or district court, or a 
judge thereof.
SEC. 3806. (2218�) If, from the showing of the petitioner, the plain� 
tiff would not be entitled to any relief; the court or judge may ref use to

THE STATE OF Iowa, 
CHAPTER 156. 
HABEAS CORPUS. 
To the sheriff of, &c., [ or to A. B., as the case may be.] 
You are hereby commanded to have the body of C. D., by you un�
lawfully detained as is alleged, before the court [ or before me, or before 
E. F ., judge, &c., as the case may he J at , on , [ or imme�
diately after being served with this writ,] to be dealt with according to
law, and have you then and there this writ with a return thereon of your
doings in the premises. 
SEC. 3808. (2220.) When the writ is allowed by a court it is to be. 
issued by the clerk, but when allowed by a judge he must issue the writ 
himself subscribing his name thereto without any seal. 
SEC. 3809 .. (~221.) If the writ is disallowed, the court or judge
shall cause the reasons of said disallowance to be appended to the peti�
tion and returned to the person applying for the writ, 
SEC. 3810. (2222.) Any judge, whether acting individually or as a
member of a court, who wrongfully and willfully refuses such allowance 
of the writ when properly applied for, shall forfeit to the party aggrieved
the sum of one thousand dollars. 
SEC. 3811. (2223.) Whenever any court or judge authorized to
grant this writ has evidence, from a judicial proceeding before them, that 
any person within the jurisdiction of such court or officer is illegally
imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, it is the duty of such court or
judge to issue or cause to be issued the writ as aforesaid, though no
application be made therefore. 
SEC. 3812. (2224.) The writ may be served by the sheriff or by 
any other person appointed for that purpose by the court or judge by 
whom it is issued or allowed, If served by any other than the sheriff, 
he p05!'es..~es the same power and is liable to the same penalty for a non�
performance of his duty as though he were the sheriff: 
SEc. 3813. (i225.) The proper mode of service is by leaving the
original writ with the defendant and preserving a copy thereof on which
to make the return of service. 
SEC. 3814. (2226.) If the defendant can not be found, or if he 
have not the plaintifff in custody, the service may be made upon any
person having the plaintifff in his custody, in the same manner and with
the same effect a...., though he had been made defendant therein. 
SEC. 3815. (2227.) If the defendant conceal himself or refuse
admittance to the person attempting to serve the writ, or if he attempt
wrongfully to carry� the plaintifff out of the county or the state after the
service of the writ as aforesaid, the sheriff or the person who is attempt�
ing to serve or who has served the writ as above contemplated, is au�
thorized to arrest the defendant and bring him together with the plaintifff
forthwith before the officer or court before whom the writ is made return�
able. 
SEC. 3816. (2228.) In order to make such arrest, the sheriff or
other p(lrson having the writ, possesses the same power as is given to a
sheriff for the arrest of a person charged with a felony. 
SEC. 3817. (2i29.) If the plaintifff can be found, and if no one
appear to have the charge or custody of him, the person having the
writ may take him into custody and make return accordingly. And to 
get possession of the plaintifff's person in such cases, he possesses the 
same po,ver as is given by the last section for the arrest of the defend�
ant. 
SEC. 3818. (2230.) The court or judge to whom the application for 
the writ is made, if satisfied that the plaintifff would suffer any irrepara�
hie injury before he could be relieved by the proceedings as above
authorized, 1nay issue a precept to the sheriff or any other person selectec 
instead, commanding him to bring the plaintifff forthwith before sucl
court or judge. 
SEC. 3819. (2231.) When the evidence aforesaid is farther sufficient
to justify the arrest of the defendant for a criminal offense committed in
connection with the illegal detention of the plaintifff, the precept must 
also contain an order for the arrest of the defendant.
SEc. 3820. (2232.) The officer or per80n to whom the precept is 
directed must execute the same by bringing the defendant, and also the 
plaintifff if required, before the court or judge issuing it, and thereupon
the defendant must make return to the writ of habeas corpus in the
same manner as if the ordinary course had been pursued. 
SEC. 3821. (2233.) The defendant may also be examined and 
committed, or bailed, or discharged, according to the nature of the 
case, 
SEc. 8822. (2234.) The writ of habeas corpus must not be diso�
beyed for any defects of form or misdescription of the plaintifff or defend� 
ant, provided enough is stated to show the meaning and intent of the 
� 
writ. 
SEC. 3823. (2235.) Any pe~on served with the writ is to be pre� 
sumed to be the person to whom it is directed, although it may be di�
rected to him by a wrong name or description or to another person. 
'8Ec. 3824. (2i36.) Service being made in any of the modes here� 
inbefore provided, the defendant must appear at the proper time and
answer the said petition. 
SEC. 3825. (2237.) He must also bring up the body of the plaintifff 
or show good cause for not doing so. 
Sze. ~1826. (2238.) A willful failure to comply with .the above 
requisitions renders the defendant liable to be attached for a contempt, 
and to be imprisoned till a compliance is obtained, and also subjects him
to the forfeiture of one thousand dollars to the party thereby aggrieved. 
SEc. 3827. (2239.) Such attachment may be served by the sheriff 
or any other pe~on thereto authorized by the judge, who shall also be
empowered to bring up the body of the plaintifff forthwith, and has for 
this purpo~e the same powers as are above conferred in similar cases, 
Sac, 382~. (224:0.) The court or officer allowing the writ must
cause the prosecuting attorney of the 1>ropcr county to be informed of
the issuing of the writ and of the time and place when and where it is 
made returnable. . 
8Ec. 3829. (2241.) The defendant in his answer must state plainly 
and unequivocally whether he then has, or at any time has had, the
plaintifff under his control and restraint, and if so the cause thereof. 
SEC. 3830. (2242.) If he ha" transferred him to another perEon lie 
must state that fact, and to whom, and the time thereof as well as the 
reason or authority therefore. 
Ssc, 3831. (2243.) If he holds him by virtue of a legal process or
written authority, a copy thereof must be annexed. 
SEC. 3832. (t244.) The plaintifff may <lemur or reply to the defend� 
ant's answer, and all issues joined thereon shall be tried by the judge
or court." 
SEC. 3833. (2245.) Such replication, except when tl1e hearing is 
before the judge of the county court may deny f he sufficiency of the
testimony to justify the action of the committing magistrate, on the trial
of which issue all written testimony before such mngist rate may be
given in evidence before the court or judge in connection with nny other
testimony which may then be produced: 
SEC. 3834. (2246.) But it is not permissible to question the cor�
rectness of the action of a grand jury in finding a bill of indictment, or
of the petit jury in the trial of a cause, nor of a court or judge when 
acting within their legitimate province and in a lawful manner. 
SEC. 3835. (2247.) If no sufficient legal cause of detention is shown
the plaintifff must be discharged. 
Ssc, 3836.� (2248.) Although the commitment of the plaintifff may 
have been irregular, still if the court or judge is satisfied from the
evidence before them that he ought to be held to bail or committed 
either for the offense charged or any other, the order may be made
accordingly. 
SEC. 3837. (2249.) The plaintifff may also in any case be commit�
ted, let. to bail, or his bail be mitigated or increased, as justice may re- 
� 
quire. . 
SEC. 8838. (2250.) Until the sufficiency of the cause of restraint
is determined the defendant may retain the plaintifff in his custody and
may use all necessary and proper means for that purpose. � 
SEC. 3839. (2251.) The plaintifff in writing, or his attorney, may
waive his right to be present at the trial, in which case the proceed�
ings may be had in his absence. The writ will in such cases be modified
accordingly. _ 
SEC. 38!0. (2252.) Disobedience to any order of discharge subjects
the defendant to attachment for a contempt, and also to the forfeiture of 
one thousand dollars to the party aggrieved, besides all damages sus�
tained by him in consequence of such disobedience. 
8Ec. 3841. (2253.) If the defendant attempt to elude the service
of the writ of habeas corpus, or to avoid the effect thereof by transfer�
ring the plaintifff to another, or by concealing him, he shall on conviction
be imprisoned in the penitentiary or county jail not more than one year
and fined not exceeding one thousand dollars. And any person know� 
ingly aiding or abetting in any such act shall be subject to the like pun-
ishment. . 
SEC. 3842. (2254.) An officer refusing to deliver a copy of any
legal process, by which he detains the plaintifff in custody, to any person 
who demands such copy and tenders the fees therefore, shall forfeit twc
hundred dollars to the per8on so detained. 
SEC. 3843. (2255.) When the proceedings are before a judge (ex�
cept when the writ is refused) all the papers in the ease, including his
final order, shall be filed with the clerk of� the district court of the county 
wherein the final proceedings were had, and a brief memorandum
thereof shall be entered by the clerk upon his judgment docket. 
CHAPTER 157. , 
(Code Chapter 128.] 
SECTION 8844. (2256.) The district court has power to change
the names of persons in the following manner : 
SEC. 3845. (2257.) The applicant for such change must file his
petition verified by his oath, stating that he is a resident of the county 
and has for one year then last past been a bona fide resident of the 
state. It must also in a general way give a description of his � person, 
stating his age, height, the color of his hair and eyes, the place of his 
birth, and who were his parents. 
CHANGING NAHES. 
SEC. 8846. (2258.) An order of the court shall thereupon be made
and entered of record giving a description of the applicant as set forth 
in the petition, the new name given, the time at which the change shall
take effect (which shall not be less than thirty days thereafter.) and 
directing in what newspaper of general circulation in the county, notice
of such change shall be published. 
SEC. 8847. (2i59.) Previous to the time thus prescribed for the 
taking effect of such change, the applicant shall cause notice thereof to 
be published for four successive weeks in the newspaper directed by the
court.

jurisdiction of the justice, such party may remit the excess and take 
judgment for the residue, but he can never afterward sue for the amount

obtaining such verdict may elect to have judgment of nonsuit entered
against the plaintifff, in which case the plaintifff shall pay the costs.

rendered by the same or different justices, may be set off against each
other.

dered by another justice, the party offering it must obtain a transcript 
thereof with a certificate of the justice who rendered it, indorsed thereon,
stating that no appeal has been taken and that the transcript was ob�
tained for the purpose of being used as a set-off in that case.

for taking an appeal has elapsed. 
SE.c. 3U02. (2318.) The justice so giving a transcript shall make

shall thenceforth be stayed. . 
SEC. 3903. (2314.) Such transcript being presented to the justice
who has rendered a judgment between the same parties as aforesaid, if 
execution has not been issued on the judgment rendered by him, he
shall strike a balance between the judgments and issue execution for
such balance. 
SEC. 3904. (2315.) If execution has already issued, the justice shall 
also issue execution on the transcript filed with him and deliver it to the 
same officer who has the other execution. 
SEC. 3905. (2316.) Such officer shall treat the lesser execution as so
much cash collected on the larger, and proceed to collect the balance

;o the usual course of practice or discipline. 
SEC. 3986. (2394.) The prohibitions in the preceding sections do

:ion upon the mere ground that he would be thereby subjected to a civil 
liability, � .

And when a detached act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given
in evidence, any other act, declaration or writing which is necessary to 
make it fully understood or to explain the same may also be given in 
evidence.

and partly of printed form, the former controls the latter when the two 
are inconsistent,

stood it,

ticated copy thereof, is competent evidence wh~never by the party's own
oath or otherwise the original is _shown to be lost, or not belonging to the 
party wishing to use the same, nor within his control. And in such case 
it is no objection to the record that no official seal is appended to the
recorded acknowledgment thereof, if, when the acknowledgment purports
to have been taken by an officer having an official seal, there be a state� 
ment in the certificate of acknowledgment that the same is made under 
his hand and seal of office and the record show by a scroll or otherwise
that there was such a seal, which will be presumptive evidence that the
official seal was attached to the original certificate.

intended to apply to all instruments heretofore recorded, as well as those 
hereafter to be recorded.

producing or procuring the same: nor do those of the fourth sub-division 
of said section apply where the purchase money or any portion thereof
has been received by the vendor, or when the vendee with the actual or
implied consent of the vendor has taken and held possession thereof 
under and by virtue of the contract, or when there is any other circum�

of the statute of frauds. ' � 
SEC. 4009. (2412.) The above regulations, relating merely to the
proof of contracts, do not prevent the enforcement of those which are
not denied in the pleadings, unless in cases where the contract is sought
to be enforced or damages to be recovered for the. breach thereof against
some pe~on other than him who made it. 
SEC. 4010. (2418.) Nothing in the above provisions shall prevent
the party himself against whom the unwritten contract is sought to be
enforced, from being called as a witness by the opposite party nor his 
oral testimony from being evidence. 
SEc. 4011. The usual protest of a notary public without proof of
his signature, or notarial seal, is prima facie evidence of what it recites
concerning the dishonor and notice of a� bill of exchange or promissory 
note. 
Bow Testimony is to lJe Procured. 
SEC. 4012. The clerks of the several courts shall, on application of
any person having a cause, or any matter pending in court, issue a sub�
prena for witnesses under the seal of the court, inserting all the names
required by the applicant in one subpoena, which may be served by the
sheriff, coroner, or any constable of the county, or by the party or any 
other person. When a subpoena is not served by the sheriff, coroner,
or constable, proof of service shall be shown by affidavit; but no costs 
of serving the same shall be allowed. . 
SEC. 4018. The subpoena shall be directed to the person therein.
named, requiring him to attend at a particular time or place, to testify 
as a witness, and it may contain a clause, directing the witness to bring
with him any book, writing, or other thing under his control, which he 
is bound by law to produce as evidence. 
SEC. 4014. (2416.) Witnesses in civil cases can not be compelled
to attend the district court out of the state where they are served, nor at
a distance of more than seventy miles from the place of their residence

place of residence or of service if not in the same county. 
SEC. 4015. (2417.) Witnesses are entitled to receive (in advance if 
demanded) their traveling fees to and from the court, together with their
fees for one day's attendance. At the commencement of each day after

that day in advance. If not thus paid they are not compelled to attend 
� � 
or remain as witnesses.
SEo. 4016. (2418.) For a failure to obey a valid subpoena without 
a sufficient cause or excuse, or for a refusal to testify after appearance,
the delinquent is guilty of a contempt of court. He is also liable to the 
party by whom he was subpeenaed for all consequences of such delin�
quency, together with fifty dollars additional damages. 
SEO. 4017. (2419.) Before a witness is thus liable for a contempt
for not appearing, he must be served personally with the process by read�
ing it to him, and by leaving a copy thereof with him if demanded, and 
it must be shown that the fees and traveling expenses allowed by law
were tendered to him if required; or it must appear that a copy of the 
subpoena, if left at his usual place of residence, came into his hands
together with the said fees and traveling expenses above mentioned. 
SEO. 4018. (2420.) If a witness conceal himself or in any other
manner attempt to avoid being personally served with a subpoena, any

means to serve the same, and for that purpose may break into any build�
ing or other place where the witness is to be found, having first made
known his business and demanded admittance.

remain in. the custody of the officer having him in charge, who shall
afford reasonable facilities for the taking of the depositions.

try, testimony may be taken in this state to be used in the courts of such
state or country, and also in all cases herein provided for taking deposi�
tions, the persons authorized to take such depositions have power to
issue subpoenas and compel obedience thereto, to administer oaths, and
do any other act of a court which is necessary for the accomplishment 
of the purpose for which they are acting. 
SEO. 4022.- (2478.) Subprenas issued by them are valid to the same
geographical extent as those emanating from a justice's court, and may
be served and returned in the same manner. 
SEO. 4023. (2479.) Any sheriff or constable, when called upon for
that purpose, shall serve such subpoenas and make return thereto. 
SEC. 4024. (2421.) In addition to the above remedies, if a party to 
� a suit in his own right, on being duly subpoenaed, fail to appear and give
testimony, the other party may, at his option, have a continuance of the
cause as in cases of other witnesses, and at the cost of the delin�
quent. 
SEC. 4025. (2422.) Or the party so calling his opponent may, in
such a case, himself become a witness, or, if he shows by his own testi�
mony or otherwise that he could not have a full personal knowledge of
the transaction, the court may order his pleading to be taken as true;
such order however is subject to be reconsidered during the term of the
court, upon satisfactory reasons being shown for such delinquency�. 
SEC. 4026. (2428.) The district court may by rule require the pro�
duition of any papers or books which are material to the just determi- 
11 
nation of any cause pending before it, for the putpose of being inspected 
and copied by or for the party thus calling for them. 
SEC. 4027. (2424.) The petition for that purpose must state the 
facts expected to be proved by such books or papers, and that, as the 
petitioner believes, such books and papers are under the control of the 
party against whom the rule is sought, and must show wherein they are
material, The rule shall thereupon be granted, to produce the books 
find papers or show cause to the contrary, it. the court deems such rule
expedient and proper. 
SEC. 40!8. (2425.) On failure to obey the rule, or show sufficient 
eause for such failure, the same consequences shall ensue as if the party 
lied failed to appear and testify when subpoenaed by the party now call� 
ing for the books and papers. 
SEC. 4029. (2426.) Though a writing called for by one party is by 
lie other produced, the party thua calling for it is not obliged to use it

signature appears to be illiterate, or a foreigner imperfectly acquainted 
with the English language, the officer taking such affidavit shall certify in
theJ�urat, that the affidavit was read in his presence to the party making 
the same, and that such party seemed to understand the same, and that 
the said party wrote his mark or signature, in the presence of the
officer taking such affidavit. 
SEC. 4088. All facts authenticated by an oath, should be attended 
by the assurance of knowledge, or at least of a belief, and to that end,
if the facts are stated in a positive manner, the oath may be that the 
affiant believes them, but if the facts, or any of them, are stated not 
positively, but as a belief, then the oath must not be of a belief, but 0� 
the truth of them, and no swearing to a belief of a belief shall be a
sufficient oath.� 
SEC. 4034. Every affidavit shall be drawn up in the first person, 
and the affiant shall, sign his name immediately below the matter
sworn to. . 
SEC. 4035. An affidavit may be made within or without this state,
before any person authorized to administer oaths. 
SEC. 4086. (2475.) Affidavits taken out of the state before any 
judge or clerk of a court of record, or before a notary public or a com�
missioner appointed by the governor of this state to take acknowledg� 
ment of deeds in the state where such affidavit is taken, are of the same
credibility as if taken within the state.

affidavit of another who is unwilling to make the same fully, he may
apply to any officer competent to take depositions as herein declared, by
petition, stating the object for which he desires the affidavit. 
SEC. 4089. (2481.) If such officer is satisfied that the object is 
legal and proper, he shall issue his subpeena to bring the witness before 
him, and if he fails then to make a full affidavit of the facts within his
knowledge to the extent required of him by the officer, the latter may
proceed to take his deposition by question and answer in writing in the
usual way, which deposition may afterwards be used instead of an ordi�
nary affidavit. 
SEO. 4040. (2482.) The officer thus applied to, may in his discre�
tion require notice of the taking of such a.ffidavit or deposition to be
given to any other person interested in the subject matter and allow him 
to be present and cross-examine such witness. 
SEc. 4041. (2483.) The court or officer to whom any ex parte affi�
davit is presented as a basis for some action, in relation to which any

or other proceeding, may be proved by pursuing the course above indi�
cated as nearly as the circumstanoes of the case will admit. 
SEC. 4045. (2430.) Such proof so made may be perpetuated and
preserved for future use by filing the papers above mentioned in the
office of the judge of the county court. And the original affidavit
appended to the notice or paper, if there be one, and if not the affidavit
by itself, is presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein, but does
not preclude other modes of proof now held sufficient. 
SEC. 4046. (2481.) A copy of the field notes of any surveyor or a
plat made by him and certified under oath as correct, may be received

pared with the originals, and certified to as true copies by the register of 
the land office at which such original entries were made, shall be deemed
a matter of record, and certified copies thereof, under the hand of said
recorder, may be received and read in evidence in all the courts in this
state, with like effect as other certified copies of original papers recorded 
in his office. 
SEC. 4050. Said recorder shall from time to time, as he may deem
