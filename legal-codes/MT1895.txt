sum must be paid by said clerk into the treasury of the county where the
cause is tried, to be applied upon the payment of the salary of the stenographer, and the prevailing party may have the amount so paid by him taxed
in his bills of costs, as proper disbursements.

Sec. 375. Every stenographer appointed under the provisions of this Title
receives an annual salary of eighteen hundred dollars, and no other compensation except as herein provided, payable in monthly installments out of the
contingent funds of the counties comprising the district for which he is appointed, according and in proportion to the number of suits entered and
commenced in the District Courts of such counties respectively the preceding
year, and it shall be the duty of the judge of such District, on the first of
january of each year, or as soon after as maybe, to apportion the amount of
such salary to be paid by each county in his district on the basis aforesaid.
The stenographer is allowed in addition to the salary and fees above provided.
in Judicial Districts containing more than one county, a mileage of ten cents
per mile for the distance traveled by him from one county seat to another in
the performance of his official duties, said mileage to be apportioned and payable in the same way as the salary.

Sec. 376. The stenographer of any District Court must attend to the
duties of his office in person, except when excused for good and sufficient
reason by order of the court, which order must be entered upon the minutes of
the court. Employment in his professional capacity elsewhere is not a good
and sufficient reason for such excuse. When the stenographer of any court
has been excused in the manner provided in this Section, the court may appoint a stenographer pro tempore, who must take the same oath and perform
the same duties and receive the same compensation during the time of his
employment as the regular stenographer.

Sec. 377. The report of the stenographer, or stenographer pro tempore, of
any court, duly appointed and sworn, when written out in long handwriting or
printed in type, and certified as being a correct transcript of the testimony
and proceedings in the case, is prima facie a correct statement of such testimony and proceedings.

that right depends.

v had in the action:

1‘ I. A cause of action arising out of the contract or transaction, set forth in

subject of the action.

2. In an action on contract, any other cause of action on contract, existing
at the commencement of the action.

See. 692. But the counterclaim, specified in Subdivision 2 of the last Section, is subject to the following rules:

I. If the action is founded upon a contract, which has been assigned by the
party thereto, other than a negotiable promissory note or bill of exchange, a
demand, existing against the party thereto, or an assignee of the contract, at
the time of the assignment thereof, and belongin to the defendant, in good
faith, before notice of the assignment, must be al owed as a counterclaim, to
the amount of the plaintifffs demand, if it might have been so allowed against
the party, or the assignee, while the contract belonged to him.

is established, which entitles the defendant to an affirmative judgment, demanded in the answer, judgment must be rendered for the defendant accordingly.

Sec. 695. In an action against an executor or administrator, or other person
sued in a representative capacity, the defendant may set forth, as a counterclaim,
a demand belonging to the decedent, or other person whom he represents, where
the person so represented would have been entitled to set forth the same, in an
action against him.

Sec. 696. In an action brought by an executor or administrator, in his representative capacity,a demand against the decedent, belonging at the time of his
death to the defendant, may be set forth by the defendant as a counterclaim,
as if the action had been brought by the decedent in his lifetime; and, if a
balance is found to be due the defendant, judgment must be rendered therefore
against the plaintifff in his representative capacity. Execution can be issued
upon such a judgment, only in a case where it could be issued upon a judgment,
in an action against the executor or administrator.

Sec. 697. If the defendant omit to set up a counterclaim in the cases mentioned in the first subdivision of Section 691, neither he nor his assignee can
afterwards maintain an action against the plaintifff therefore.

Sec. 698. When cross demands have existed between persons under such
circumstances that, if one had brought an action against the other, a counterclaim could have been setup, the two demands shall be deemed compensated,
so far as they equal each other, and neither can be deprived of the benefit thereof, by the assignment or death of the other.

Sec. 699. A defendant may set forth, in his answer, as many defenses or
counterclaims, or both, as he has, whether they are such as were formerly denominated legal or equitable. Each defense or counterclaim must be separately
stated and numbered. Unless it is interposed as an answer to the entire complaint, it must distinctly refer to the cause of action which it is intended to
answer.

Sec. 700. A partial defense may be set forth, as prescribed in the last Section ; but it must be expressly stated to be a partial defense to the entire complaint, or to one or more separate causes of action, therein set forth. Upon a
demurrer thereto, the qauestion is, whether it is suhicient for that purpose.

Sec. 722. s .e plaintifff fails to reply or demurr to the counterclaim, the
defendant si- . be entitled to the same relief, as a plaintili upon the failure of
defendr-...;r  demur to or answer the complaint.

S..- ;.:3. The defendant may also demur to the reply, or to a separate
tram.-~ ' to, or avoidance of, a defense or counterclaim, contained in the reply.

adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims. Such an allegation is equivalent to setting forth the instrument according to its legal effect.

Sec. 748. The insertion in a pleading of a copy of a written instrument is
equivalent to setting forth the instrument according to its legal effect.

Sec. 749. In pleading the Statute of Limitations, it is not necessary to state
the facts showing the defense, but it may be stated generally that the cause
of action is barred by the provision of Section (giving the number of
the Section and subdivision thereof, if it is so divided, relied upon), of the
Code of Civil Procedure; and if such allegation be controverted, the party
pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts showing that the cause of action
is so barred.

Sec. 750. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it is
sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of its passage, and
the court thereupon shall take judicial notice thereof.

_ Sec. 751. In an action for libel and slander, it is not necessary to state
in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintifff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of
action arose; but it is sufiicient to state, generally, that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintifff ; and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintifff must establish, on the trial, that i{ was so published or
s oken.

P Sec. 752. In the actions mentioned in the last '- - 'tion, the defendant may.
in this answer, allege both the truth of the matte‘ urged as defamatory, and
any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amou .* . f damages; and whether

he prove the justification or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances. '

Sec. 75 3. Where the judgment may determine the ultimate rights of two
or more defendants, as between themselves, a defendant who requires such a
determination must demand it in his answer. '

The controversy between the defendants must not delay a judgment, to
which the plaintifff is entitled, unless the court otherwise directs.

Sec. 754. Each material allegation of the complaint, not controverted by
the answer, and each material allegation of new matter in the answer, not controverted by the reply, where a reply is required, must-, for the purposes of the
action be taken as true. But an allegation of new matter in the answer, to
which a reply is not required, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed
controverted by the adverse party.

Sec. 755. An allegation that the party has not sufiicient knowledge or information to form a belief, with respect to a matter, must, for all purposes,
including a criminal prosecution, be regarded as an allegation that the person
verifying the pleading has not such knowledge or information.

Sec. 756. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to the claim
or defense, and which could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving
it- insufficient.

Sec. 757. The plaintifff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on
motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer or reply, alleging facts material to the cause occurring after the former complaint, answer or reply.

Sec. 758. All pleadings subsequent to the complaint must be filed with the
clerk, and copies thereof served upon the adverse party or his attorney.

Sec. 770. No variance between the allegation in a ,:leading and the proof
is to be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party to his
prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon the arerits. Whenever it
appears that a party has been so misled, the court Hm)’ order the pleadings to
be amended, upon such terms as may be just.

Sec. 771. Where the variance is not mate:-1.1!. as provided in the last SecSection 770. Material variances, [tow provided{for.

tion, the court may direct the fact to be fount‘ 'tr-cording to the evidence, or
may order an immediate amendment, with mt 3.-at--.
Sec. 772. Where, however, the allegatii 1* . f we claim or defense, to which

the proof is directed, is unproved, not in - mnc particular or particulars only,
but in its general scope and meaning, it i:-‘ :;«_)t to be deemed a case of variance,
within the last two Sections, but a f'.iiu' e u’ proof.

Sec. 773. Any pleading may be ;u~— '.,‘i.(lL'd once by the party of course, and
without costs, at any time before, 1112:‘.-.cr or demurrer filed, or twent days
after demurrer and before the trig‘ cf the issue of law thereon, by ling he

same "as amended, and servinsr’ '; . spy on the adverse party, who may have
twe'n’ty_days’thereafter in w‘...'v.... 1; answer, reply or demur to the amended
pleading.

Sec. 774. The court in  m f ../therance of justice, and on such terms as

may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name
of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge_the time for answer, reply, or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to or in the presence of the adverse party, allow upon
such terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in
other particulars; and upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the
time limited by this Code; and may, also, u on such terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his legal representative rom a judgment, order, or'other
proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect ; provided that application therefore be made within reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such judgment, order, or
proceeding was taken. When from any cause the summons in an action has
not been personally served on the defendant, the court may allow on such
terms as may be just, such defendant or his legal representative, at any time
within one year after the rendition of any judgment in such action, to answer
to the merits of the original action. ‘

Sec. 775. When in an action to recover the possession of personal property, the person making any affidavit did not truly state the value of the
property, and the officer taking the property, or the sureties on any bond or
undertaking, is sued for taking the same, the officer or sureties may in their
answer set up the true value of the property, and that the person in whose behalf said affidavit was made was entitled to the possession of the same when
said affidavit was made, or that the value in the affidavit stated was inserted
by mistake, the court must disregard the value as stated in the affidavit.

Sec. 776. Upon the decision of a demurrer, the court may in its discretion,
allow the party in fault to plead anew or amend, upon such terms as are just.
If a demurrer to a complaint is allowed, because two or more causes of action
have been improperly united, the court may, in its discretion, and 'upon such
terms as are just, direct that the action be divided into as many actions as are
necessary for the proper determination of the causes of action therein stated.

Sec. 777. When the plaintifff is ignorant of the name of the defendant, such
defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and
when his true name is discovered, the pleadings or proceedings may be
amended accordingly. It is sufficient in all actions, papers, pleadings or proceedings to designate any party or person by the initial letter or letters, or
some contraction of the Christian or first name or names, instead of stating the
Christian or first name in full.

Sec. 778. The court must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error
or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does not affect the substantial
rights of the parties, and no judgment shall be reversed or adected by reason
of such error or defect.

Sec. 779. When a demurrer to any pleading is sustained or overruled,
and time to amend, answer or reply is given, the time so given runs from
service of notice of the decision or order, except when the party against whom
the decision is made is in court. In such case the time runs from the making
of the decision or order.

5. When the defendant has removed or disposed of his property, or is about
to do so, with intent to defraud his creditors.

Sec. 802. An order for the arrest of _the defendant must be obtained from
the judge of the court in which the action is brought.

Sec. 803. The order must be made whenever it shall appear to the judge,
by the affidavit of the plaintiffi, or some other person, that a sufficient cause of
action exists, and that the case is one of those mentioned in Section 801. Before making the order the judge must require a written undertaking on the
part of the plaintiffi, with at least two sufhcient securities, to the effect that, if
the defendant recover judgment, or if the court shall finally decide that the
plaintifff was not entitled to an order of arrest, the plaintifff will pay all costs

and charges that may be awarded to the defendant, and all damages which he
may sustain by reason of the arrest, if the same be wrongful or without
sufficient cause, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking, which
shall be at least five hundred dollars.

Sec. 804. Each of the sureties must annex to the undertaking an affidavit
that he is a resident and householder, or freeholder, within the State, and
worth double the sum specified in the undertaking, over and above all his
debts and liabilities, exclusive of property exempt from execution. The_ undertaking must be filed with the clerk of the court.

Sec. 805. The order may be made at the time of issuing the summons, or
at any time afterwards, before judgment. It must require the sheriff of the
county where the defendant may be found, forthwith to arrest him, and hold
him to bail in a specified sum, and to return the order at a time therein mentioned to the clerk of the court in which the action is pending.

Sec. 806. The order of arrest with a copy of the af¥idavit upon which it is
made, must be delivered to the sheriff, who, upon arresting the defendant,shall
deliver him a copy of the affidavit and also, if defendant desires, a copy of the
order of arrest.

Sec. 807. The sheriff must execute the order by arresting the defendant,
and keeping him in custody until discharged by law. But the sheriff is not
bound to keep such person under arrest more than twenty-four hours, unless the
plaintifff advance each day the expense of keeping such person; which expense
shall be taxed as costs in the action, and in no case shall be a charge against
the county.

Sec. 808. The defendant, at any time before execution. is discharged from
arrest, either upon giving bail or upon depositing the amount mentioned in
the order as provided in this Chapter.

Sec. 809. The defendant may give bail by causing a written undertaking to
be executed by two or more sufficient sureties, stating their places of residence
and occupations, to the effect that they are bound in the amount mentioned
in the order of arrest, that the defendant shall at all times render himself
amenable to the process of the court during the pendency of the action, and
to such as may be issued to enforce the judgment therein ; or that they will
pay to the plaintifff the amount of any judgment which may be recovered in
the action.

Sec. 810. At any time before judgment, or within ten days thereafter, the
bail may surrender the defendant in their exoneration, or he may surrender
himself to the sheriff of the county where he was arrested.

Sec. 811. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail, at any
time or place before they are finally charged, may themselves arrest him, or
by a written authority indorsed on a certified copy of the undertaking, may
empower the sheriff to do so. Upon arrest of the defendant by the sheriff, or
upon his delivery to the sheriff by the bail, or upon his own surrender, the
bail shall be exonerated; provided, such arrest, delivery or surrender, take
place before the expiration of ten days after judgment; but if such arrest, delivery or surrender be not made within ten days after judgment, the bail shall
be finally charged on their undertaking, and be bound to pay the amount of
the judgment within ten days thereafter.

Sec. 812. If the bail neglect or refuse to pay the judgment within ten days
after they are finally charged, an action may be commenced against such bail
for the amount of such original judgment.

Sec. 813. The bail must also be exonerated by the death of the defendant.
or his imprisonment in a State penitentiary or prison ; or by his legal discharge
from the obligation to render himself amenable to the process.

Sec. 814. Within the time limited for that purpose, the sheriff must file the
order of arrest in the office of the clerk of the court in which the action is
pending, with his return indorsed thereon, together with a copy of the undertaking of the bail. The original undertaking he must retain in his possession,
until filed as herein provided. The plaintifff, within ten days thereafter, may
serve upon the sheriff a notice that he does not accept the bail, or he shall be
deemed to have accepted them, and the sheriff shall be exonerated from liability. If no notice be served within ten days, the original undertaking must be
filed with the clerk of the court.

Sec. 815. Within five days after receipt of notice, the sheriff or defendant

may give to the plaintifff, or his attorney, notice of the justification of the same, .

or other bail (specifying the place of residence and occupation of the latter),
before a judge of the court , or clerk thereof, at a specified time and place; the
time not to be less than five nor more than ten days thereafter, except by consent of parties. In case other bail be given, there shall be a new undertaking.

Sec. 816. The qualifications of bail shall be as follows :

° 1. Each of them must be a resident and householder, or freeholder, within
the county.

2. Each must be worth the amount specified in the order of arrest, or the
amount to which the order is reduced, as provided in this Chapter, over and
above all his debts and liabilities exclusive of property exempt from execution ;
but the judge or clerk, on justification, may allow more than two sureties to
justify severally in amounts less than that expressed in the order, if the whole
justification be equivalent to that of two sufficient bail.

Sec. 817. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail must attend
before the judge or clerk, at the time and place mentioned in the notice, and
may be examined- on oath, on the part of the plaintifff, touching his sufficiency
in such manner as the judge or clerk, in his discretion, may think proper.
The examination shall be reduced to writing, and subscribed by the bail, if
required by the plaintifff.

Sec. 818. If the judge or clerk shall find the bail sufficient he must annex
the examination to the undertaking, indorse his allowance thereon, and
cause them to be filed, and the sheriff shall thereupon be exonerated from
liability.

Sec. 819. The defendant may, at the time of his arrest, instead of giving
bail, deposit with the sheriff the amount mentioned in the order. In case the
amount of bail be reduced, as provided in this Chapter, the defendant may
deposit such amount instead of giving bail. In either case the sheriff shall
give the defendent a certificate of the deposit made, and the defendant shall
be discharged from custody.

Sec. 820. The sheriff must, immediately after the deposit, pay the same
into court, and take from the clerk receiving the same, two certificates of such
payment, the one of which he must deliver or transmit to the plaintifff or his
attorney, and the other to the defendant. For any default in making such
payment. the same proceedings may be had on the official bond of the sheriff
to collect the sum deposited, as in other cases of delinquency.

Sec. 82 I. If money be deposited as provided in the last two Sections, bail may
be given and may justify upon notice, at any time before judgment; and on the
filing of the undertaking and justification with the clerk, the money deposited
shall be refunded by such clerk to the defendant.

Sec. 822. Where money shall have been deposited, if it remain on deposit
at the time of recovery of a judgment in favor of the plaintifff, the clerk must,
under direction of the court, apply the same in satisfaction thereof ; and after
satisfying the judgment, must refund the surplus, if any, to the defendant. If
the judgment be in favor of the defendant, the clerk must, under direction of
the court, refund him the whole sum deposited and remaining unapplied.

Sec. 823. If, after being arrested, the defendant escape or be rescued, the
sheriff is liable as bail, but he may discharge himself from such liability by the
giving and justification of bail at any time before judgment.

Sec. 824. If a judgment be recovered against the sheriff upon his liability as

bail, and an execution thereon be returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the
same proceeding may be had on his official bond for the recovery of the whole
or any deficiency, as in other cases of delinquency.

Sec. 825. A defendant arrested, may, at any time before justification of bail,
apply to the judge who made the order, or the court in which the action is
pending, upon reasonable notice to the plaintifff, to vacate the order of arrest
or to reduce the amount of bail. If the application be made upon affidavits
on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintifff may oppose the
same by affidavits, or other proofs in addition to those on which the order of
arrest was made.

Sec. 826. If, upon such application, it satisfactorily appears that there was
not sufficient cause for the arrest, the order shall be vacated; or if it satisfactorily appears that the bail was fixed too high, the amount shall be reduced.

Sec. 840. The plaintiffi, in an action to recover possession of personal property, may, at the time of issuing summons, or at any time before answer,
claim the delivery of such property to him, as provided in this Chapter.

Sec. 841. When a delivery is claimed, an affidavit must be made by the
plaintifff, or some one in his behalf, stating:

I. That the plaintiffi is the owner of the property claimed, particularly
describing it, or is lawfully entitled to the possession thereof.

2. That the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant.

3. That the same has not been taken fora tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant
to statute, or seized under an execution or an attachment against the property
of the plaintifff, or if so seized that it is by statute exempt from seizure; and,

4. The actual value of the property.

Sec. 842. The plaintiffi or his attorney may thereupon, by an indorsement
in writing upon the affidavit, require the sheriff of the county where the property claimed may be to take the same from the defendant.

Sec. 843. Upon receipt of the affidavit and notice, with a written undertaking, executed by two or more sufficient sureties, approved by the sheriff,
to the effect that they are bound to the defendant in double the value
of the property, as stated in the affidavit for the prosecution of the action and
for the return of the property to the defendant, if return thereof be adjudged,
and for the payment to him of such sum as may from any cause be recovered
against the plaintifff, the sheriff must forthwith take the property described in
the affidavit, if it be in the possession of the defendant or his agent, and retain
it in his custody.

He must also, without delay, serve on the defendant acopy of the affidavit,
notice, and undertaking, by delivering the same to him personally, if he can
be found, or to his agent, from whose possession the property is taken ; or, if
neither can be found by leaving them at the usual place of abode of either,
with some person of suitable age and discretion ; or, if neither have any known
place of abode, by putting them in the nearest post office, directed to the
defendant.

Sec. 844. The defendant may, within two days after service of a copy of
the affidavit and undertaking, give notice to the sheriff that he excepts to the
sufficiency of the securities. If he fails to do so, he shall be deemed to have
waived all objections to them. When the defendant excepts, the sureties must
justify on notice, in like manner as upon bail on arrest; and the sheriff is responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties until the objection to them is either
waived, as above provided, or until they justify. If the defendant except to
the sureties, he cannot claim the property, as provided in Section 849.

Sec. 845. In all cases when a judgment is rendered in an action to recover
the possession of personal property for the return thereof, or its value in case
a return cannot be had, it is the duty of the party against whom such judgment
shall be rendered to return the same in as good condition as the same was
when possession thereof was taken by him.

Sec. 846. In case such property, while in the possession of the party against
whom such judgment shall be rendered, or while the same is unlawfully detained from the party entitled to the possession thereof, be materially injured
or lessened in value by use or otherwise, then a return or offer to return shall
not be deemed a compliance with the undertaking given for its return, but an
action may be maintained for the value thereof as assessed by the jury or
court, and damages for its detention.

Sec. 847. In case such action to recover possession of personal property is
brought against any sheriff or other officer who may have levied upon and
seized the same under authority of any attachment or other process, and judgment shall be rendered in favor of such officer, for the return of the property,
the party against whom such judgment’ is rendered may nevertheless make return of said property, notwithstanding the same may have been injured or lessened in value, and thereupon it is the duty of such officer to immediately
advertise the same for sale as in cases of sales of property under execution,and
apply the proceeds of the sale thereof, after paying the costs, towards the payment and satisfaction of any judgment that may have been rendered.

Sec. 848. Such second taking of such property referred to in the preceding
Section does not release or discharge the sureties on any undertaking given for
the return of such property, but an action may be maintained on such undertaking and recovery thereon had, unless the property shall have been actually
returned in accordance with the judgment rendered.

Sec. 849. At any time before the delivery of the property to the plaintifff,
the defendant may, if he do not except to the sureties of the plaintifff, require
the return thereof, upon giving to the sheriff a written undertaking executed
by two or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that they are bound in double
the value of the property, as stated in the affidavit of the plaintifff, for the delivery thereof to the plaintifff, if such delivery be adjudged, and for the payment to him of such sum as may for any cause be recovered against the defendant. If a return of the property be not so required within five days after
the taking and serving notice to the defendant, it shall be delivered to the
plaintifff, except as provided in Section 854.

Sec. 850. The defendant's sureties, upon notice to the plaintifff of not less
than two nor more than five days, shall justify before the judge or clerk, in the
same manner as upon bail on arrest; and upon such justification the sheriff
must deliver the property to the defendant. The sheriff shall be responsible
for the defendant's sureties until they justify, or until the justification is

completed or expressly waived, and may retain the property until that time; but
if they, or others in their place, fail to justify at the time or place appointed,
he shall deliver the property to the plaintifff.

Sec. 851. The qualification of sureties and their justification shall be such
as are prescribed by this Title in respect to bail upon an order of arrest.

Sec. 852. If the property, or any part thereof, be concealed in a building
or enclosure, the sheriff shall publicly demand its delivery; if it be not delivered, he shall cause the building or enclosure to be broken open, and take
the property into his possession; and if necessary, he may call to his aid the
power of the county.

Sec. 853. When the sheriff shall have taken property, as in this Chapter
provided, he shall keep it in a secure place, and deliver it to the party entitled
thereto, upon receiving his lawful fees for taking, and his necessary expenses
for keeping the same.

Sec. 854. If the property taken be claimed by any other person than the
defendant or his agent, and such person make affidavit of his title thereto, or
right of the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and
serve the same upon the sheriff, the sheriH shall not be bound to keep the
property or deliver it to the plaintifff, unless the plaintifff on demand of him or
his agent, indemnify the sheriff against such claim by an undertaking by two
sufficient sureties, accompanied by their affidavits that they are each worth
double the value of the property as specified in the affidavit of the plaintifff,
over and above their debts and liabilities, exclusive of property exempt from
execution, and are freeholders or householders in the county; and no claim to
such property by any other person than the defendant or his agent shall be
valid against the sheriff unless so made.

Sec. 855. The sheriff shall file the notice, undertaking and affidavit, with
his proceedings thereon, with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending within twenty days after taking the property mentioned therein.

Sec. 856. Where the affidavit describes two or more chattels of the same
kind, it must state the number thereof, and where it describes achattel in bulk,
it must state the weight, measurement, or other quantity, as nearly as can be
ascertained. Where it describes two or more chattels, it may, at the election
of the plaintifff, state the aggregate value of all; or, separately, the value of
any chattel or of any class of chattels, and the aggregate value of the remainder, if any. Where it states separately the value of one or more chattels or
classes of chattels, the defendant may require, as prescribed in this Chapter,
the return of any or all of the chattels or classes of chattels, the value of which
is thus stated, or of the portion thereof which has been taken. If he procures
such a return, the remainder must be delivered to the plaintifff, except as is
otherwise prescribed in this Chapter.

Sec. 857. The sheriff must take a less number or quantity, if the whole of
the property described in the affidavit cannot be found.

Sec. 858. The defendant may by answer defend, on the ground that a third
person was entitled to the property, without connecting himself with the latter’s title.

Sec. 859. Where the plaintifff is entitled to judgment by default, for want
of an appearance or pleading, the court to which he applies for judgment may
ascertain and determine the damages to which he is entitled, and the value of
the property, if necessary; or may direct a reference for that purpose.

879. Dissolution or modi cation.
880. Costs may be awar ed.
881. Injunction order as to corporation.

Sec. 870. An injunction is an order requiring a person to refrain from a
particular act. The order may be granted by the court in which the action is
brought, or by a judge thereof, and when made by a judge be enforced as the
order of the court.

Sec. 871. An injunction order may be granted in the following cases:

I. When it shall appear by the complaint that the plaintifff is entitled to
the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually.

2. When it shall appear by the complaint or affidavit that the commission
or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the plaintifff.

3. When it shall appear during the litigation that the defendant is doing,
or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or sufiering to be done, some
act in violation of the plaintifff's rights respecting the subject of the action, and
tending to render the judgment ineffectual.

4. When it appears, by affidavit, that the defendant, during the pendency
of the action, threatens, or is about to remove, or to dispose of his property,
with intent to defraud the plaintifff, an injunction order may be granted, to
restrain the removal or disposition.

Sec. 872. The injunction order may be granted at the time of issuing the
summons upon the complaint, or at any time afterward before judgment, upon

affidavits. In the one case, the complaint with or without affidavits to sup. ”

port it, and, in the other, the affidavits shall show satisfactorily that sufficient
grounds exist therefore. An injunction order shall not be granted on the complaint alone, unless:

I. It be duly verified.

2. The material allegations of the complaint setting forth the grounds
therefore, be made positively and not upon information and belief.

When granted on the complaint, a copy thereof, including the verification,
shall be served with the injunction order when granted upon the complaint,
with afhdavits to support it, or upon affidavits alone, a copy of the affidavits
likewise shall be served with the injunction order. Any person qualified to
serve a summons may serve the order and affidavits.

Sec. _87 3. The order may be granted, upon or without notice, in the discretion of the court or judge, unless the defendant has answered, in which case,
it can be granted only upon notice, or an order to show cause. Where an application for an injunction is made upon notice, or an order to show cause,
either before or after answer, the court or judge may enjoin the defendant
until the hearing and decision of the application, by an order which is called a
restraining order. In no case shall an injunction order or restraining order be
issued without notice unless it appears to the court or judge, that irreparable
injury would result by the delay of giving notice.

Sec. 874. On granting an injunction or restraining order, the court or
judge may require, except when the State, a county, or any subdivision thereof, or municipal corporation, or a married woman in a suit for a divorce against
her husband, is a party plaintifff, awritten undertaking on the part of the
plaintifff, with sufficient sureties, to the efiect that the plaintifff will pay to the
party enjoined such damages, not exceeding an amount to be specified, as

such party may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court finally decide
that the plaintifff was not entitled thereto. Within five days after the service
of the injunction, the defendant may except to the sufficiency of the sureties.
If he fails to do so he is deemed to have waived all objection to them. When
excepted to, the plaintifff’s sureties, upon notice to the defendant of not less
than two nor more than five days, must justify before a judge or clerk in the
same manner as upon bail on arrest, and upon failure to justify, or if others in
their place fail to justify at the time and place appointed, the order granting an
injunction shall be dissolved.

Sec. 875. If the court or judge deem it proper that the defendant, or any
of several defendants, should be heard before granting the injunction, an
order may be made requiring cause to be shown, at a specified time and place,
why the injunction should not be granted, and the defendant may in the
meantime be restrained. Cause may be shown upon affidavits or oral testimony.

Sec. 876. Upon the hearing of an application to vacate or modify an injunction order, or on a hearing to show cause, the court or judge may require
a new undertaking, in the same or a different sum, to be given by the plaintifff,
with like sureties, and to the like efiect, as upon granting of the original order.
The persons executing the new undertaking become liable thereon, as if they
had executed it upon the granting of the original order. The persons who
executed the original undertaking remain liable thereon until the new undertaking is given and approved, and no longer. Upon such hearing the court or
judge may, where the alleged wrong or injury is not irreparable and is capable
of being adequately compensated for in money, vacate the injunction order
upon the defendant's executing an undertaking in such form and amount and
with such sureties as the court or judge shall direct, conditioned to indemnify
the plaintifff against loss sustained by reason of vacating such injunction
order.

Sec. 877. Upon the hearing of a contested application for an injunction
order, or to vacate or modify such an order, a verified answer has the effect
only of an affidavit.

Sec. 878. If an injunction order be granted without notice, the ‘defendant,
atany time before the trial, may apply upon reasonable notice, or upon an
order to show cause returnable at a specified time or forthwith, after service
thereof, to the judge who granted the injunction order, or to the court in which
the action is brought, to dissolve or modify the same. The application may
be made upon the complaint and affidavit on which the injunction order was
granted, or upon affidavit on part of defendant, with or without the answer. If
the application be made upon affidavits on part of defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiffi may oppose the same by affidavits or oral testimony, in addition to those on which the injunction order was granted. The defendant
may also use oral testimony. T

Sec. 879.- If, upon such application, it satisfactorily appear that there is not
sufficient ground for the injunction order, it shall be dissolved; or, if it satisfactorily appear that the extent of the injunction order is too great, it shall be
modified.

Sec. 880. Where an injunction order is granted without notice, and the
same is afterwards dissolved upon application of the party enjoined thereby,
the court or judge to whom the application to dissolve is made, may award as
costs of the application against the plaintiffi, and in favor of the party applying, such sum as to the court or judge may appear just, not less than ten
dollars, nor more than one hundred dollars.

Sec. 881. An injunction order to suspend the general and ordinary business
of a corporation must not be granted without due notice of the application
therefore to the proper officers or managing agent of the corporation, except
when the State is a party to the action.

Sec. 890. The plaintifff, at the time of issuing the summons, or at any time
afterward, may have the property of the defendant attached, as security for the
satisfaction of any judgment that may be recovered,unless the defendant give
security to pay such judgment, as is in this Chapter provided, as follows:

In an action upon a contract, express or implied, for the direct payment of
money, where the contract is not secured by any mortgage or lien upon real or
personal property, or any pledge of personal property, or, if originally secured,
such security has, without any act of the plaintifff, or the person to whom the
security was given, become valueless.

Sec. 891. The clerk of the court must issue the writ of attachment, upon
receiving an affidavit by or on behalf of the plaintifff showing:

I. That the defendant is indebted to the plaintifff (specifying the amount of
such indebtedness over and above all legal counterclaims) upon a contract, express or implied, for the direct payment of money, and that the payment of the
same has not been secured by any mortgage or lien upon real or personal property, or any pledge of personal property, or, if originally so secured, that such
security has, without any act of the plaintifff, or the person to whom the security
was given, become valueless; and,

.2. That the attachment is not sought, and the ‘action is not prosecuted to
hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the defendant.

Sec. 892. Before issuing the writ the clerk must require a written undertaking on the part of the plaintifff, with two or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by the clerk, in a sum not less than double the amount claimed by the
plaintifff, if such amount be one thousand dollars or under, or in case the amount
so claimed by plaintifff shall exceed one thousand dollars, then in a sum equal
to such amount, but in no case shall an undertaking be required exceeding in

amount the sum of ten thousand dollars. The condition of such undertaking
shall be to the effect that if the defendant recover judgment, or if the court
shall finally decide that the plaintiffi was not entitled to an attachment, the
plaintiffi will pay all costs that may be awarded to the defendant, and all damages he may sustain by reason of the issuing out of the attachment, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking. Within five days after service of the
summons in the action, the defendant may except to the sufiiciency of the sureties. If he fails to do so he is deemed to have waived all objections to them.
When excepted to, the plaintifff's sureties, upon notice to the defendant of not
less than two days nor more than five days, must justify before a judge of the
District Court, or before the clerk thereof, and upon failure to justify, or if
others in their place fail to justify, at the time and place appointed, the clerk
or judge shall issue an order vacating the writ of attachment.

Sec. 893. The writ must be directed to the sheriff of any county in which
property of such defendant may be, and must require him to attach and safely
keep all the property of such defendant within his county not exempt from
execution, or so much thereof as may be sufiicient to satisfy the plaintifff's demand, the amount of which must be stated in conformity with the complaint,
unless the defendant give him security by the undertaking of at least two
sufficient sureties, in an amount sufficient to satisfy such demands, besides
costs, or in an amount equal to the value of the property which has been or
is about to be attached; in which case to take such undertaking. Several
writs may be issued at the same time to the sherifis of different counties. In
no case shall the sherifi attach more property than appears necessary to satisfy
the plaintifff's demand.

Sec. 894. The rights or shares which the defendant may have in the stock
of any corporation or company, together with the interest and profits thereon,
and all debts due such defendant, and all other property in this State of such
defendant not exempt from execution, may be attached, and if judgment be
recovered, be sold to satisfy the judgment and execution.

Sec. 895. The sherifi to whom the writ is directed and delivered must execute the same without delay, and if the undertaking mentioned in Section 893
be not given, as follows:

1. Real property standing u n the records of the county .-n. of t'.-«:
defendant must be attached by ling with the county clerk a cc '1 :h:- ~- ~

and within the county, or at the residence of either, if within the ct-.m2, .»
copy of the writ, with the similar description and notice. If r em 1. n . 
cupant of the property, a copy of the writ, together with such ' '- -° Ion 4.: 3
notice, must be posted in a conspicuous lace upon the property .1... (‘«r"‘.» '.

4. Stocks or shares, or interest in stocks or shares, of any -‘ u. ~r.aI'-W a»:

company, must be attached by leaving with the president or other in: ad L: .*'n-;

writ, and a notice stating that the stock or interest of the defendant is attached,
in pursuance of such writ.

5. Debts and credits, and other personal property, not capable of manual
delivery, must be attached by leaving with the person owing such debt, or
having in his possession or under his control such credits and other personal
property, or with his agent, a copy of the writ and a notice that the debts
owing by him to the defendant, or the credits and other personal property in
his possession, or under his control belonging to the defendant, are attached in
pursuance of such writ.

Sec. 896. Upon the application of a sheriff, holding a writ of attachment,
the president or other head of an association or corporation, or the secretary,
cashier, or managing agent thereof, or a debtor of the defendant, or a person
holding property, including a bond, promissory note, or other instrument for
the payment of money, belonging to the defendant, must furnish to the sherifi
a certificate, under his hand, specifying his right to a number of shares of the
defendant, in the stock of the association or corporation, with all dividends
declared, or encumbrances thereon; or the amount, nature and description of
the property, held for the benefit of the defendant, or of the defendant’s interest in property so held, or of the debt or demand owing to the defendant, as
the case requires.

Sec. 897. If a person to whom application is made, as prescribed in the last
Section, refuses to give such a certificate; or if it is made to appear, by affidavit, to the satisfaction of the court, or a judge thereof, that there is reason to
suspect that a certificate given by him is untrue, or that it failed fully to set
forth the facts, required to be shown thereby, the court or judge may make an
order, directing him to attend, at a specified time, and at a place within .the
county to which the writ is issued, and submit to an examination under oath,
concerning the same. The order may, in the discretion of the court or judge,
direct an appearance before a referee named therein.

Sec. 898. The sheriff must take into his custody all books of account,
vouchers, and other papers, relating to the personal property attached, and all
evidences of the defendant’s title to the real property attached, which he must
safely keep. The sheriff, to whom the writ of attachment is delivered, may
levy, from time to time, and as often as is necessary, until the amount for which
it was issued has been secured.

Sec. 899;. Upon receiving information in writing from the plaintiffi or his
attorney, that any person has in his possession or under his control any credits
or other personal property belonging to the defendant, or is owing any debt to
the defendant, the sherifi must serve upon such person a copy of the writ and
a notice that such credit, or other property, or debts, as the case may be, are
attached, in pursuance of said writ.

Sec. 900. All persons having in their possession or under their control any
credits or other personal property belonging to the defendant, or owing any
debts to the defendant, at the time of service upon them of a copy of the writ
and notice, shall be, unless such property be delivered up or transferred, or
such debts be paid to the sheriff, liable to the plaintifff for the amount of such
credits, property, or debts, until the attachment be discharged, or any judgment recovered by him be satisfied.

Sec. 901. Any person owing debts to the defendant, or having in his possession or under his control any credits or other personal property belonging to
the defendant, may be required to attend before the court or judge, or referee
appointed by the court or judge, and be examined on oath respecting the same.
The defendant may also be required to attend, for the purpose of giving
information respecting his property, and may be examined on oath. The court
or judge may, after such examination, order personal property, capable of manual delivery in the hands or under the control of such person or of the defendant,

to be delivered to the sheriff on such terms- as may be just, having reference
to any liens thereon or claims against the same, and a memorandum to be
given of all other personal property, containing the amount and description
thereof.

Sec. 902. The sheriff must make a full inventory of. the property attached,
and return the same with the writ. When the sheriff has levied several writs
of attachment on the same property only one inventory must be made. To
enable him to make such return as to debts and credits attached, he must
request, at the time of service, the person owing the debt or having the credit,
to give him a memorandum stating the amount and description of each; and
if such memorandum be refused, the sheriff may apply upon one day's notice
to the court or judge for an order to compel such memorandum to be given.
If the order be granted it shall also direct the payment of costs of the motion
by the person refusing.

Sec. 903. If any of the property attached be perishable, the sheriff must
sell the same in the manner in which such property is sold on execution. The
proceeds and other property attached by him must be retained by him to

answer any judgment that may be recovered in the action, unless sooner sub- ‘.

jected to execution upon another judgment, recovered previous to the issuing
of the attachment. Debts and credits attached may be collected by him if the
same can be done without suit. The sheriff's receipt is a sufiicient discharge
for the amount paid.

Sec. 904. Whenever property has been taken by an officer under a writ of
attachment, and it is made to appear satisfactorily to the court or a judge
thereof that the interest of the parties to the action will be subserved by a sale
thereof, the court may order such property to be sold in the same manner
as property is sold under an execution, and the proceeds to be deposited in
the court to abide the judgment in the action.

Sec. 905. Application for the order shall be upon such notice to the adverse
party or his attorney as the court or judge considering the nature and condition of the property may direct. If it shall appear to the court or judge that
the delay necessary to give notice would cause a material depreciation in the
value of property, the order may be made without notice.

Sec. 906. If personal property attached be claimed by a third person he
shall give notice thereof to the sheriff, and deliver to him an affidavit stating
his claim, ownership, and a description of the property, and unless the plaintifff
within ten days after receiving notice thereof give the sheriff a good and
sufficient bond to indemnify him against loss or damage by reason of retaining said property, the sheriff shall deliver the same to such person.

Sec. 907. The death of the defendant does not release the attached property
and a lien of the attachment may be enforced as in the case of other liens.

Sec. 908. If judgment be recovered by plaintifff, the sheriff must satisfy the
same out of the property attached by him which has not been delivered to the
defendant or claimant as hereinbefore provided, or subjected to execution on
another judgment, recovered previous to the issuing of the attachment, if it be
sufiicient for that purpose:

I. By paying to the plaintifff the proceeds of all sales or perishable property,
or property ordered by the court or judge to be sold by him, or of any debts
or credits collected by him, or so much thereof as shall be necessary to satisfy
the judgment;

2. If any balance remain due, and an execution shall have been issued on
the judgment, he must sell under the execution so much of the property, real
or personal, as may be necessary to satisfy the balance, if enough for that purpose remain in his hands. Notices of the sales must be given, and the sales
conducted as in other cases of sales on execution.

Sec. 909. If, after selling all property attached by him remaining in his
hands and applying the proceeds, together with the proceeds of any debt or

credits collected by him, deducting his fee, to the payment of the judgment,
any balance that shall remain due, the sheriff must proceed to collect such balance as upon an execution in other cases. Whenever the judgment shall have
been paid, the sheriff, upon reasonable demand, must deliver over to the defendant the attached property remaining in his hands, and any proceeds of
property attached unapplied on the judgment.

Sec. 910. If the execution is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the
plaintifff may prosecute any undertaking given pursuant to Section 893, or Section 913, or he may proceed as in other cases upon the return of an execution.

Sec. 911. If the defendant recover judgment against the plaintifff, any
undertaking received in the action, all of the proceeds of sales and money collected by the sheriff, and all the property attached remaining in the sheriff's
hands, must be delivered to the defendant or his agent ; the order of attachment shall be discharged and the property released therefrom.

Sec. 912. Whenever the defendant has appeared in the action, he may,
upon reasonable notice to the plaintifff, apply to the court in which the action
is pending, or to the judge thereof, for an order to discharge the attachment,
wholly or in part, and upon the execution of the undertaking mentioned in the
next Section, an order may be made, releasing from the operation of the attachment any or all of the property attached; and all of the property so released, and all of the proceeds of the sale thereof, must be delivered to the defendant, upon the justification of the sureties on the undertaking, if required
by the plaintifff.

Sec. 913. Before making such order, the court or judge must require an
undertaking on behalf of the defendant, by at least two sureties residents and
freeholders, or householders, in the State to the effect that in case the plaintifff
recover judgment in the action, the defendant will, on demand, redeliver the
attached property so released to the proper officer, to be applied to the payment of the judgment, or, in default thereof, that the defendant and sureties
will, on demand, pay to the plaintifff the full value of the property released.
The court or judge making the order may fix the sum for which the undertaking shall be executed, and if necessary in fixing the such sum to know the
value of the property released, the same may be appraised by one or more disinterested persons, to be appointed for that purpose. The sureties may be required to justify before the court or judge, and the property attached cannot
be released from the attachment without their justification, if the same be
required.

Sec. 914. The defendant may also at any time, either before or after the
release of the attached property, or before any attachment shall have been
actually levied, apply on motion, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiffi, to
the court in which the action is brought, or to a judge thereof, that the writ
of attachment be discharged on the ground that thesame was improperly or
irregularly issued.

Sec. 915. If the motion be made upon affidavits on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintifff may oppose the same by affidavits or
other evidence, in addition to those on which the attachment was made.

Sec. 916. If, upon such application, it satisfactorily appears that the writ
of attachment was improperly or irregularly issued, it must be discharged.
But the court or judge may allow the plaintifff to amend his affidavit or undertakin .

Segc. 917. The defendant or a person who has acquired a lien upon, or
interest in his property, after it was attached, may, at any time before the
actual application of the attached property, or the proceeds thereof, to the
payment of a judgment recovered in the action, apply to vacate or modify the
writ of attachment, or to increase the security given by the plaintifff, or for
one or more of those forms of release, together, or in the alternative.

Sec. 918. An application, specified in the last Section, may be founded

only upon the papers upon which the writ was granted ; in which case‘ it must
be made to the court or judge, with or without notice, as the court or judge
deems proper, or it may be founded upon proof, by affidavits, on the part of
the defendant, or a person who has acquired a lien upon or interest in his
property after it was attached, in which case it must be made to the court or
judge upon notice; and it may be opposed by new proof, by affidavit or other
evidence on the part of the plaintifff, tending to sustain any grounds of attachment.

Sec. 919. The sheriff must return the writ of attachment with the summons, if issued at the same time; otherwise, within twenty days after its
receipt, with a certificate of his proceedings indorsed thereon or attached
thereto; and whenever an order has been made discharging or releasing an
attachment upon real property, a certified copy of such order must be filed in
the office of the county clerk in which the notice of the attachment has been
filed, and be indexed in like manner. '

Sec. 920. All liens by attachment shall accrue at the time the property of
the defendant shall be attached by the officer charged with the execution
of the writ, in the order in which the writs are levied; and said lien shall not
be affected by any subsequent attachment, or by any judgment obtained
subsequent thereto.

The writ of attachment first placed in the hands of the sherifi must be
executed first, and when there are several writs against the same defendant,
they must be executed in the order in which they were received by the sheriff.
No written specification of property to be levied upon must be required by the
sheriff, except as to property referred to in Section 899 and Subdivision 2, of
Section 895. -The sheriff must indorse upon each writ of attachment received
by him the time when the same was received, specifying the day, hour and
minute.

Sec. 921. If a writ of attachment is levied upon the interest of one or more
partners, in goods or property of a partnership, the other partners, who are not
defendants in the action, or any of them, may, at any time before final jud ment, apply to the judge who granted the writ, or to the court, upon an afgdavit showing the facts, for an order to discharge the attachment, as to that
interest.

Sec. 922. Upon such an application, the applicant must‘ give an undertaking, with at least two sufficient sureties, to the effect that they will pay to the
sherili, on demand, the amount of any judgment, which may be recovered
against the partner who is defendant in the action ; or which may be recovered
against him, in any other action, wherein the other partners are not defendants,
and wherein a writ of attachment, or an execution, may come into the sheriff's
hands, at any time before the writ of attachment, which was so levied, is
vacated, and annulled; not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking,
which must not be less than the value of the interest of the defendant, in the
goods or property seized, by virtue of the attachment, as fixed by the court or
judge. If the value, in the opinion of the court or judge, is uncertain, the sum
must be such as the court or judge determines. For the purpose of fixing the
sum or to determine the sufficiency of its sureties, the court or judge may
receive affidavits for oral testimony, or may direct a reference.

Sec. 923. Personal property mortgaged or pledged may be taken on attachment, as provided in Section 3869, of the Civil Code. _

Sec. 924. There must be kept in the office of the county clerk of each
county, a book called “Attachment Book,” in which must be entered by such
clerk, in alphabetical order, the names of all persons against whom any writ or
notice of attachment has been filed in his office. There must also be entered
in said book the time such writ or notice was filed. Such entry must be made
under an appropriate head for that purpose.

Sec. 925. No credit, or money due or to become due, of or to any person in

the possession or under the control of a public. officer or Board, including all
the officers of a municipal corporation, must be attached or garnished while in
such possession or under such control, and no attachment can be made until
the money or a warrant or other evidence of indebtedness therefore, has been
delivered to the owner of the same, or to some one for his use.

service of process out of any of the courts of this State to take possession of
any cattle or horses running at large and commonly known as range stock,
between the first day of November and the next succeeding fifteenth day of

with the service of the same to file a copy thereof, with a notice appended
thereto containing the number, as near as may be, and a description of said
stock by marks and brands, that such property or a portion thereof, asthe case
may be, is attached or levied upon, in pursuance of such process, with the
county clerk of the county wherein such property is running at large, within

trial of that issue, to be drawn out of the box containing the ballots then

trial jurors returned and attending the court must be placed together in the
same box before a jury is drawn therefrom.

Sec. 1057. If a sufficient number of jurors duly drawn and notified do not

reason a sufficient number of jurors to try the issue is not obtained, from the
persons notified, under an order made as prescribed in this Section, the court
may make another order, or successive orders, until a sufficient number is
obtained.

Each person so notified must attend at a time required by the notice, and,
unless excused by the court or set aside, must serve as a juror upon the trial.

at which any material fact occurred, it may order them to be conducted, in a
body, under the charge of an officer, and one person representing each party,
to the place, which shall be shown to them by the persons appointed by the
court for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person, other than
the persons so appointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected with
the trial, and such persons shall not speak to the jury upon any matters connected with the subject of the action, but may point out to the jury the property in litigation, or the place at which any material fact occurred.

after the case is submitted to them, they shall be admonished by the court

to form or express an opinion thereon until the case is finally submitted to
them.

Sec. 1083. Upon retiring for deliberation, the jury may take with them all
papers which have been received as evidence in the cause, except depositions

the court, the officer having them under his charge must not suHer any communication to be made to them, or make any himself, except to ask them if
they or two-thirds of them are agreed upon a verdict; and he must not, before
their verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon.

Sec. 1085. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be a disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony, or if they desire to

be informed of any point of law arising in the cause, they may require the
officer to conduct them into court. Upon their being brought into court, the
information required must be given in the presence of, or after notice to, the
parties or counsel. Such information must be given in writing or taken down
by the stenographer.

Sec. 1086. If, after the empaneling of the jury, and before verdict, a juror
become sick, so as to be unable to perform his duty, the court may order him
to be discharged. In that case the trial may proceed with the other jurors, or
another juror may be sworn and the trial begin anew; or the jury may be discharged and a new jury then or afterward empaneled.

Sec. 1087. In all cases where the jury are discharged, or prevented "from
giving a verdict, by reason of accident or other cause, during the progress of
the trial, or after the case is submitted to them, the action may be again tried
immediately, or at a future time, as the court may direct.

Sec. 1088. While the jury are absent the court may adjourn from time to
time, in respect to other business; but it is nevertheless open for every purpose connected with the case submitted to the jury until a verdict is rendered
or the jury discharged. The court may direct the jury to bring in a sealed
verdict, at the opening of the court, in case of an agreement during a recess or

A adjournment for the day.

Sec. 1089. When the jury, or two-thirds of them, have agreed upon a ver.
dict, they must be conducted into court, their names called by the clerk, and
the verdict rendered by their foreman ; the verdict must be in writing, signed
by the foreman, and must be read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry
made whether it is their verdict, Either party may require the jury to be
polled, which is done by the court or c erk asking each jurorif it is his verdict;
if upon such inquiry or polling, more than one-third of the jurors disagree
thereto, the jury must be sent out again, but if no such disagreement be
expressed, the verdict is complete, and the jury discharged from the case.

Sec. 1090. When the verdict is announced, if it is informal or insufficient
in not covering the issue submitted, it may be corrected by the jury under the
advice of the court, or the jury may be again sent out.

to be stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The special
verdict or finding must be filed with the clerk and entered upon the minutes.
Where a special finding of facts is inconsistent with the general verdict, the
former controls the latter, and the court must give judgment accordingly.

In no case shall special issues be submitted to the jury when in the opinion
of the court, a general verdict would be sufficient.

Sec. 1102. When a verdict is found for the plaintifff in an action for the
recovery of money, or for the defendant when a counterclaim for the recovery
of money is established exceeding the amount of the plaintifff's claim as established, the jury must also find the amount of the recovery.

Sec. 1103. In an action for the recovery of specific personal property, if
the property has not been delivered to the plaintifff, or the defendant by his
answer claim a return thereof, the jury, if their verdict be in favor of the
plaintifff, or if, being in favor of the defendant, they also find that he is
entitled to a return thereof, shall find the value of the property (but failure to
find all the facts mentioned in this Section shall not invalidate the verdict),
and may at the same time assess the damages, if they are claimed in the cornplaint or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason of the
taking or detention of such property.

Sec. 1104. Where, upon the trial of an issue by a jury, the case presents
only questions of law, the judge may direct the jury to render averdict in favor

court before judgment, or for carrying a judgment or order into effect.

4. When it is necessary for the information of the court in a special
proceeding. '

Sec. I132. A reference may be ordered to any person or persons, not exceeding three, agreed upon by the parties. If the parties do not agree, the

whom there is no legal objection.

Sec. 113 3. Every referee, before acting as such, shall take and subscribe an

referee must be heard and disposed of by the court. Afiidavits may be read

judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been
tried by the court.

Sec. 1152. No particular form of exception is required, but the grounds of
the objection shall be particularly stated except as provided in the next preceeding Section, and when the exception is to the verdict or decision, upon
the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence to justify it, the objection must

signed by the judge or referee, with his certificate to the effect that the same
is allowed, and shall then be filed with the clerk.

Sec. 1156. Exceptions to any decision made after judgment may be presented to the judge at the time of such decision, and be settled or noted, as
provided in Section 1154, and a bill thereof may be presented and settled afterward as provided in Section 115 5, and within like periods after entry of the
order, upon appeal from which such decision is reviewable.

Sec. 115 7. If the judge in any case refuse to allow an exception in accordance with the facts, the party desiring the bill settled may apply by petition to

notice of such entry by Section 1155, and the bill shall be prepared and settled
in a similar manner. If a bill of exceptions has already been settled and

given, and the time for redemption has expired, and the last redemptioner or
his assignee, is entitled to a sheriff's deed ; but in all cases the judgment debtor shall have the entire period of one year from the date of the sale to redeem
the property. If the judgment debtor redeem, he must make the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a redemptioner. If the debtor redeem, the effect of the sale is terminated, and he is restored to his estate.
Upon a redemption by a debtor, the person to whom the payment was made
must execute and deliver to him a certificate of redemption, acknowledged or
proved before an officer authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances

same, such conveyance shall be executed to him by the officer who made the
sale, if he still be in office, but in the case the officer who made such sale is not

whom he seeks to redeem, and serve with his notice to the sheriff :

Sec. 12 39. Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption, the
court may restrain the commission of waste on the property, by order granted
with or without notice on the application of the purchaser or the judgment
creditor. But it is not waste for the person in possession of the property at
the time of sale, or entitled to possession afterward during the period allowed

profits have been received by the judgment creditor or purchaser, or his or their
assigns, from the property thus sold preceding such redemption, the amount of
such rents and profits shall be a credit upon the redemption money to be paid;
and if the redemptioner or judgment debtor, before the expiration of the time
allowed for such redemption, demands in writing of such purchaser or creditor,
or his assigns, a written and verified statement of the amount of such rents and
profits thus received, the period for redemption is extended five days after
such sworn statement is given by such purchaser or his assigns to such redemptioner or debtor. If such purchaser or his assigns shall, for a period of one
month from and after such demand, fail or refuse to give such statement, such
redemptioner or debtor may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction, to compel an accounting and disclosure of such rents and profits, and
until fifteen days from and after the final determination of such action, the
right of redemption is extended to such redemptioner or debtor.

Sec. 1241. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularities in the
proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the judgment,
he may recover the price paid with interest from the judgment creditor. If
the purchaser of property at sheriff's sale, or his successor in interest, fail to
recover possession, in consequence of irregularity in the proceeding concerning
the sale, or because the property sold was not subject to execution and sale,
the court having jurisdiction thereof shall, on petition of such party in interest,
or his attorney, revive the original judgment for the amount paid by such purchaser at the sale, with interest thereon from the time of payment at the same
rate that the original judgment bore; and, when so revived, the said judgment
shall have the same effect as an original judgment of the said court of that date,
and bearing interest as aforesaid; and any other or after acquired property,
rents, issues, or profits of the said debtor shall be liable to levy and sale under
execution, in satisfaction of such debt, but no property of such debtor, sold
bona fide before the filing of such petition, shall be subject to the lien of said
judgment. Thenotice of the filing of such petition shall be made by filing a
notice thereof in the office of the county clerk where such property may be
situated, and that said judgment shall be revived in the name of the original
plaintifff or plaintifffs for the use of said petitioner, the party in interest.

Sec. 1242. When property liable ‘to an execution against several persons is
sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judgment is satisfied out
of the proceeds of the sale of property of one of them, or one of them pays,

without a sale, more than his proportion, he may compel contribution from the‘

others; and when a judgment is against several and is upon an obligation of
one of them as security for another, and the surety pays the amount, or any
part thereof, either by sale of his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal. In such case the person so paying or contributing is
entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment,
if, within ten days after his payment, he file with the clerk of the court where
judgment was rendered, notice of his payment and claim to contribution or
repayment. Upon the. filing of such notice, the clerk must make an entry
thereof in the margin of the docket.

Sec. 1243. The provisions of Section 925, of this Code, relating to the garnishment of public officers, apply to the levy of an execution.

Sec. 1260. When an execution against property of the judgment debtor, or
of any one of several debtors in the same judgment, issued to the sheriff of
the county where he resides, or if he does not reside in this State, to the sheriH
of the county where the judgment roll is filed, is returned unsatisfied in whole
or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time after such return is made, is
entitled to an order from a judge of the court, requiring such judgment debtor
to appear and answer concerning his property before such judge, or a referee
appointed by him, at a time and place specified in the order; but no judgment
debtor must be required to attend before a judge or referee out of the county
in which he resides. ‘

Sec. 1261. After the issuing of an execution against property, and upon
proof, by aliidavit of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of a judge of the
court, that any judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to
apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such judge may, by an order,
require the judgment debtor to appear, at a specified time and place, before
such judge, or a referee appointed by him, to answer concerning the same ; and
such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property of the
judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided upon
the return of an execution. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of
the judgment debtor, the judge may, upon aiiidavit of the judgment creditor,
his agent, or attorney, if it appear to him that there is danger of the debtor
absconding, order the sheriff to arrest the debtor and bring him before such
judge. Upon being brought before the judge, he may be ordered to enter into an
undertaking, with sufiicient surety, that he will attend from time to time before
the judge or referee, as may be directed during the pendency of proceedings
and until the final determination thereof, and will not in the meantime dispose
of any portion of his property not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking he may be committed to prison.

Sec. 1262. After the issuing of an execution against property, and before
its return, any person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff
the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the
execution ; and the sheriff's receipt is sullicient discharge for the amount so
paid.

Sec. 1263. After the issuing or return of an execution against property of
the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment,
or upon proof by alhdavit or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the judge, that
any person or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted
to him in an amount exceeding hfty dollars, the judge may, by an order, require such person or corporation, or any oFF:cer or member thereof, to appear
at a specified time and place before him, or a referee appointed by him, and
answer concerning the same.

Sec. 1264. Witnesses may be required to appear and testify before the
judge or referee, upon any proceeding under this Chapter, in the same manner
as upon the trial of an issue.

Sec. 1265. The judge or referee may order any property of a judgment

debtor, not exempt from execution, in the hands of such debtor or any other
person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied toward the satisfaction
of the judgment.

Sec. 1266. If it appear that a person or corporation, alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted to him, claims an interest in
the property adverse to him, or denies the debt, the court or judge may authorize, by an order made to that effect, the judgment creditor to institute an
action against such person or corporation for the recovery of such interest or
debt; and the court or judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt, until an action can be commenced and prosecuted
to judgment. Such order may be modified or vacated by the judge granting
the same, or the court in which the action is brought, at any time, upon such
terms as may be just.

Sec. 1267. If any person, party or witness disobey an order of the referee,
properly made, in the proceedings before him under this Chapter, he may be
punished by the court or judge ordering the reference for a contempt.

Sec. 1268. A party or witness examined in proceedings authorized by this
Chapter is not excused from answering a question on the ground that his examination will tend to convict him of the commission of a fraud, or to prove
that he has been a party or privy to, or knowing of, a conveyance, assignment,
transfer, or other disposition of property for any purpose; or that he or any
other person claims to be entitled, as against the judgment creditor, or a receiver appointed or to be appointed in the proceedings, to hold property
derived from or through the judgment debtor, or to be discharged from the
payment of a debt which was due to the judgment debtor, or to a person in his
behalf. But an answer cannot be used as evidence against the person so
answering in a criminal action or criminal proceeding.

Sec. 1269. At any time after making an order requiring the judgment
debtor or any other person to attend and be examined, as prescribed in this
Chapter, the judge may make an order appointing a receiver of the property
of the judgment debtor. At least two days’ notice of the application for the
order appointing a receiver, must be given personally to the judgment debtor,
unless the judge is satisfied that he cannot, with reasonable diligence, be found
within the State; in which case, the order must recite that fact, and may dispense with notice, or may direct notice to be given in any manner which the
judge thinks proper. But where the order to attend and be examined, has been
served upon the judgment debtor, a receiver may be appointed upon the return
day thereof, or at the close of the examination, without further notice to him.

Sec. 1270. An order appointing a receiver must be filed in the office of the
clerk of the court where the judgment roll is filed, or a transcript of the judgment, and the receiver must take and subscribe the ofiicial oath, and give an
undertaking, if required by the judge.

Sec. 1271. The property of the judgment debtor is vested in a receiver, who
has duly qualified, from the time of filing the order appointing him, subject to
the following exceptions :

1. Real property is vested in the receiver, only from the time when the
order is filed with’ the clerk of the court, or a certified copy thereof, as the
case may be, is filed with the clerk of the county where it is situated.

2. Where the judgment debtor, at the time when the order is filed, resides in
another county of the State, his personal property is vested in the receiver,
only from the time when a copy of the order, certified by the clerk in whose
office it is filed, is filed with the clerk of the District Court of the county where
he resides.

Sec. 1272. Where the receiver's title to personal property has become
vested, as prescribed in the last Section, it also extends back, by relation, for
the benefit of the judgement creditor in whose behalf the proceedings were
instituted, as follows:

1. Where an order requiring the judgment debtor to attend and be examined has been served, before the appointment of a receiver, or the judgment
debtor has been brought before the judge on arrest, the receiver's title extends
back, so as to include the personal property of the judgment debtor, at the time
of the service of the order or his arrest.

2. Where an order has not been served, or no arrest, as specified in the foregoing Subdivision, but an order has been made, requiring a person to attend
and be examined, concerning property belonging or a debt due, to the judgment debtor, the receiver's title extends to the personal property belonging to
the judgment debtor, which was in the hands, or under the control, of the person or corporation thus required to attend, at the time of the service of the
order; and to a debt then due him from that person or corporation.

3. In every other case, where notice of the application for the appointment
of the receiver was given to the judgment debtor, the receiver's title extends
to the personal property of the judgment debtor, at the time when the notice
was served, either personally, or by complying with the requirements of an
order, prescribing a substitute for personal service.

4. Where the case is within two or more of the foregoing Subdivisions of
this Section, the rule most favorable to the judgment creditor must be adopted.

But this Section does not affect the title of a purchaser in good faith, without notice, and for a valuable consideration ; or the payment of a debt in good
faith, and without notice.

Sec. 1290. There is but one action for the recovery of debt, or the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real estate or personal property,
which action must be in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. In
such action the court may, by its judgment, direct a sale of the incumbered
property (or so much thereof as may be necessary), and the application of the
proceeds of the sale to the payment of the costs of the court and the expenses
of the sale, and the amount due the plaintifff ; and if it appear from the sheriff's
return that the proceeds are insuiiicient, and a balance still remain due, judgment can then be docketed for such balance against the defendant or defendants personally liable for the debt, and it becomes a lien upon the real estate
of such judgment debtor, as in other cases on which execution may be issued.
No person holding a conveyance from or under the mortgagor of the property
mortgaged, or having a lien thereon, which conveyance or lien does not appear
of record in the proper office at the time of the commencement of the action,
need be made a party to such action ; and the judgment therein rendered, and
the proceedings therein had, are as conclusive against the party holding such
unrecorded conveyance or lien as if he had been made a party to the action.

Seé. 1291. If there be surplus money remaining after payment of the
amount due on the mortgage, lien or encumbrance, with costs, the court may
cause the same to be paid to the person entitled to it, and in the meantime
may direct it to be deposited in court.

Sec. 1292. If the debt for which the mortgage, lien or encumbrance is held
is not all due, as soon as sufiicient of the property has been sold to pay the
amount due, with costs, the sale must cease; and afterward, as often as more
becomes due, for principal or interest, the court may, on motion, order more
to be sold. But if the property cannot be sold in portions, without injury to
the parties. the whole may be ordered to be sold in the first instance and the
entire debt.and costs paid, there being a rebate of interest where such rebate
is proper.

Sec. 1293. When a mortgage confers a power of sale, either upon the
mortgagee or any other person, to be executed after a breach of the obligation
for which the mortgage is a security, either an action may be maintained under this Chapter to foreclose, or proceedings may be had under provisions of

the mortgage.

answer, the plaintifff shall not recover costs. But in actions which the plaintifff
has brought under Section 2326 of the Revised Statutes of the United States
to determine an adverse claim, the plaintifff shall recover costs if the defendant
does not relinquish in the proper United States land oFF:ce or disclaim in writing any interest or estate in the property within twenty days from the filing
of said adverse claim in such land oFF:ce.

Sec. 1312. In an action for the recovery of real property, where the plaintifff
shows a right to recover at the time the action was commenced, but it appears
that his right has terminated during the pendency of the action, the verdict
and judgment must be according to the fact, and the plaintifff may recover
damages for withholding the property.

Sec. 1 313. When damages are claimed for withholding the property recovered, upon which permanent improvements have been made by a defendant, or those under whom he claims, holding under color of title adversely to

Sec. I 314. The court in which an action is pending for the recovery of real
property or mining claims, or for damages for an injury, or to quiet title or to
determine adverse claims thereto, or a judge thereof, may, on motion, upon
notice by either party, for good cause shown, grant an order allowing to such
party the right to enter into or upon the property or mining claim and make
survey or measurement thereof, or of any tunnels, shafts, or drifts therein, for
the purpose of the action, even though entry for such purpose has to be made
through other lands or mining claims belonging to parties to the action.

Sec. 1315. The order must describe the property, and a copy thereof must
be served on the owner or occupant; and thereupon such party may enter the
property, with necessary surveyors and assistants, and make such survey and
measurement; but if unnecessary damage be done to the property, he is liable
therefore.

Sec. 1316. A mortgage of real property shall not be deemed a conveyance,
whatever its terms, so as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover possession of the real property without a foreclosure and sale. When the mortgage confers a power of sale, as mentioned in Section 3821, of the Civil Code,
possession may be recovered according to the terms of the mortgage.

Sec. 1317. Whenever any person shall have any right to or interest in any
lead, lode, or mining claim which is in the possession of another person, and it
shall be 'necessary for the ascertainment, enforcement, or protection of such
right or interest that an inspection, examination, or survey of such lead, mine,
lode, or mining claim should be had or made; or whenever any inspection,

examination, or survey of any such lode or mining claim shall be necessary to
protect, ascertain, or enforce the right or interest of any person in another
mine, lode or mining claim, and the person in possession of the same shall
refuse, for a period of three days after demand therefore in writing, to allow
such inspection, examination, or survey to be had or made, the party so desiring the same may present to the District Court, or a judge thereof, of the
county wherein the mine, lead, lode, or mining claim is situated, a petition,
under oath, setting out his interest in the premises, describing the same, that
the premises are in the possession of a party, naming him, the reason why such
examination, inspection, or survey is necessary, the demand made on the person in possession so to permit such examination, inspection, or survey, and his
refusal so to do. The court or judge shall thereupon appoint a time and place
for hearing such petition, and shall order notice thereof to be served upon the
adverse party, which notice shall be served at least one day before the day of
hearing. On the hearing either party may read affidavits or produce oral testimony, and if the court or judge is satisfied that the facts stated in the petition are true, he shall make an order for an inspection, examination, or survey
of the lode or mining claim in question in such manner, at such time, and by
such persons as are mentioned in the order. Such person shall thereupon have
free access to such mine, lead, lode, or mining claim for the purpose of making
such inspection, examination, or survey, and any interference with such person
while acting under such order shall be contempt of court. If the order of the
court is made while an action is pending between the parties to the order, the
costs of obtaining the order shall abide the result of the action, but all costs of
making such examination or survey shall be paid by the petitioner.

Sec. 1318. The court or judge, may by injunction,upon good cause shown,

the decision of the action.

- Sec. 1322. In an action brought to determine the respective rights of
claimants to the possession of a mining claim or quartz lode, under the provisions of the Acts of Congress of the United States, it is immaterial which
party is in possession, and it is sufhcient to confer jurisdiction upon the court,
if it appears from the pleadings that the application for a patent has been
made and an adverse claim thereto filed and allowed in the proper land office;
and the verdict or decision must find which party is entitled to the possession
of the premises in dispute.

Sec. 1341. An action for the partition of real property shall not be brought
by an infant, except by the written authority of the district judge of the county
in which the property. or a part thereof, is situated. The authority shall not
be given unless the district judge is satisfied, by affidavit or other competent
evidence, that the interests of the infant will be promoted by bringing the
action. A judgment for a partition shall not be rendered in such an action unless

the court is satisfied that the interests of the infant will be promoted thereby,
and that fact is expressly recited in the judgment. A guardian ad [item for
an infant party, in an action for partition, can be appointed only by the court
or judge, and must give an undertaking in a sum lixed by the judge for the
faithful discharge of his trust, which undertaking must be approved by the
judge and filed with the clerk.

Sec. I 343. The plaintifff may, at his election, make a tenant in dower, for
life, or for years, of the entire property, or a creditor or other person, having a
lien or interest, which attaches to the entire property, a defendant in the action.
In that case the final judgment may either award to such a party his or her entire
right and interest, or the proceeds thereof, or may reserve and leave unalfected
his or her right or‘ interest, or any portion thereof. A person specilied in this
Section who is not made a party, is not aEected by the judgment in the action.

Sec. 1344. The interests of all the persons in the property, whether such
persons be known or unknown, must be set forth in the complaint specilically
and particularly, as far as known to the plaintifff, and if one or more of the

plaintifff must file in the office of the county clerk of the county, or of the several counties in which the property is situated, a notice of the pendency of the
action, containing the names of the parties so far as known, the object of the
action, anda description of the property to be affected thereby. From the
time of filing such notice, all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the
pendency of the action.

Sec. I 347. The summons must be directed to all the joint tenants and tenants in common, and all persons having an interest in, or any liens of record by
mortgage, judgment or otherwise, upon the property, or upon any particular
portion thereof, and generally to all persons unknown who have or claim any
interest in the property.

Sec. 1348. If a party having a share or interest is unknown, or any one of
the known parties reside out of the State or cannot be found therein, and such
fact is made to appear by affidavit, the summons may be served on such
absent or unknown party by publication, as in other cases. When publication
is made, the summons, as published, must be accompanied by a general statement of the nature of the action and a brief description of the property which
is the subject of the action.

Sec. I 349. The defendants who have been personally served with the summons and a copy of the complaint, or who have appeared without such service,
must set forth in their answers, fully and particularly, the origin, nature and

extent of their respective interests in the property; and if such defendant claim
a lien on the property by mortgage, judgment or otherwise, they must state
the original amount, and date of the same, and the sum remaining due thereon;
also whether the same has been secured in any other way or not ;and if secured,
the nature and extent of such security, or they are deemed to have waived
their right to such lien.

Sec. 1350. The right of the several parties, plaintifff as well as defendant,
may be put in issue, tried,and determined in such action. The title or interest
of the plaintifff in the property, as stated in the complaint, may be controverted by the answer. The title or interest of any defendant in the property,
as stated in the complaint, may also be controverted by his answer, or the
answer of any other defendant ; and the title or interest of any defendant, as
stated in his answer, may be controverted by the answer of any other defendant, and the issues joined as prescribed in Title VI., of this Code, which may
be tried before a jury if the court so direct.

See. I 351. When a sale of the premises is necessary, the title must be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction of the court, before the judgment of sale
can be made; and where service of the summons has been made by publication, like proof must be required of the right of the absent or unknown parties,
before such judgment is rendered; except where there are several unknown
parties having an interest in the property, their rights may be considered
together in the action, and not as between themselves.

Sec. 1352. Whenever from any cause it is, in the opinion of the court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to make a complete partition, in the first
instance, among all the parties in interest, the court may first ascertain and
determine the shares or interest respectively held by the original co-tenants,
and thereupon adjudge and cause a partition to be made, as if such original cotenants were the parties and sole parties in interest, and the only parties to
the action, and thereafter may proceed in like manner to adjudge and make
partition separately of each share or portion so ascertained and allotted, as between those claiming under the original tenant to whom the same shall have
been so set apart, or may allow them to remain tenants in common thereof, as
they may desire.

Sec. I353. If it appears to the court, by the certificate of the clerk of the
court and county clerk, or by the sworn or verified statement of any person
who may have examined or searched the records, that there are outstanding
liens or encumbrances of record upon such real property, or any part or portion
thereof, which existed and were of record at the time of the commencement
of the action, and the persons holding such liens are not made parties to the
action, the court must either order such persons to be made parties to the action, by an amendment or supplemental complaint, or appoint a referee to
ascertain whether or not such liens or encumbrances have been paid, or if not
paid, what amount remains due thereon, and their order among the liens or
encumbrances severally held by such persons and the parties to the action,
and whether the amount remaining due thereon has been secured in any manner, and if secured, the nature and extent of the security.

Sec. 1354. The plaintifff must cause a notice to be served, a reasonable time
previous to the day for appearance before the referee appointed, as provided
in the last Section, on each person having outstanding liens of record, who is
not a party to the action, to appear before the referee at a specified time and
place, to make proof, by his own affidavit or otherwise, of the amount due or
to become due contingently or absolutely thereon. In case such person be
absent, or his residence be unknown, service may be made by publication, or
notice to his agents, under the direction of the court, in such manner as may
be proper. The report of the referee thereon must be made to the court, and
must be confirmed, modified, or set aside, and a new reference ordered, as the
justice of the case may require.

See. I 355. If it be alleged in the complaint and established by evidence, or
if it appear by the evidence without such allegation in the complaint to the
satisfaction of the court, that the property or any part is so situated that the
partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners, the court may
order a sale thereof; otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, it must
order a partition according to the respective rights of the parties as ascertained
by the court, and appoint three referees therefore, and must designate the portion to remain undivided for the owners whose interests remain unknown, or
are not ascertained.

Sec. 1356. When the site of an incorporate city or town is included within
the exterior boundaries of the property to be partitioned, on said fact being
established by evidence, the following proceedings shall be had: The court
shall thereupon direct the referees to survey and appraise the entire property
to be partitioned by actual lots and subdivisions then existing in the actual
possession of the several tenants in common, exclusive of the value of improvements thereon, first setting apart necessary portions of the property for ways,
roads and streets, as in Section 1 3 58, of this Code, provided, and to report such
survey and separate appraisement on each lot and subdivision to the court.
The court may confirm, change, modify, or set aside the report in whole or in
part, and if necessary appoint new referees. When, after the final confirmation
of the report of such survey and appraisement, it shall appear by’ evidence to
the satisfaction of the court that an equitable partition of the whole property
is impracticable, and a sale of the site of such city, town, or any portion thereof,
will be for the best interests of the owners of the whole property, it shall order
a sale thereof; provided, that within sixty days thereafter any tenant in common, or tenants in common, having improvements erected on any town or
city lot or subdivision included in such order of sale, shall have the prior
right to purchase the same at such appraised valuation, and pay into court the
amount so appraised as the value thereof, and upon such payment the title
shall vest in such purchaser or purchasers, and the court shall cause to be
executed by said referees a deed for such lot or subdivision in fee and in
severalty to such purchaser or purchasers; such further proceedings shall then
be had as to the remainder of the property, and the money so paid to the
court, as by this Chapter provided.

Sec. 1 3 5 7. If, during the pendency of the action, any of the parties die or
become insane or otherwise incompetent, the proceedings shall not for that
cause be delayed or suspended, but the attorney who has appeared for such
party may continue to represent such interest; and in case any such party has
not appeared by an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent
the interest which was held by such party, until his heirs or legal representatives, or successors in interest, shall have appeared in the action; and an attorney so appointed shall be allowed by the court a reasonable compensation for
his services, which may be taxed as costs against the share or interest represented by such attorney, and may be adjudged a lien thereon, in the discretion
of the court.

Sec. 1358. In making partition the referees must divide the property and
allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective rights of the parties as
determined by the court, pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, designating the several portions by proper landmarks, and may employ a surveyor
with the necessary assistants to aid them. Before making partition or sale the
referees may, whenever it will be for the advantage of those interested, set
apart a portion of the property for a way, road or street, and the portion so set
apart shall not be assigned to any of the parties or sold, but shall remain an
open and public way, road,or street, unless the referees shall set the same
apart as a private way for the use of the parties interested, or some of them,
their heirs and assigns, in which case it shall remain such private way. Whenever

the referees have laid out on any tract of land, roads sufficient in the judgment of said referees to accommodate the public and private wants, they shall
report that fact to the court, and upon the confirmation of their report all
other roads on said tract shall cease to be public highways.

Sec. I 359. Whenever it shall appear, in an action for the partition of lands,
that one or more of the tenants in common, being the owner of an undivided
interest in the tract of land sought to be partitioned, has sold to another person a specific tract by metes and bounds out of the common land, and executed
to the purchaser a deed of conveyance, purporting to convey the whole title to
such specific tract to the purchaser in fee and in severalty, the land described
in such deed shall be allotted and set apart in partition to such purchaser, his
heirs or assigns, or in such other manner as shall make such deed effectual
as a conveyance of the whole title to such segregated parcel, if such tract or
tracts of land can be so allotted or set apart without material injury of the
rights and interests of the other co-tenants who may not have joined in such
conveyance; provided, that in all cases the court shall direct the referees, in
making partition of land, to allot the share of each of the parties owning an
interest in the whole or in any part of the premises sought to be partitioned
and to locate the share of each co-tenant, so as to embraceas far as practicable
the improvements made by such co-tenant upon the property, and the value
of the improvements made by the tenants in common must be excluded from
the valuation in making allotments, and the land must be valued without regard to such improvements, in case the same can be done without material
injury to the rights and interests of the other tenants in common owning such
land. .

Sec. I 360. The referees must make a report of their proceedings, specifying
therein the manner in which they executed their trust, and describing the
property divided, and the shares allotted to each party, with a particular description of each share. ‘

Sec. 1361. The court may confirm, change, modify or set aside the report,
and if necessary appoint new referees. Upon the report being confirmed, judgment must be rendered that such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is binding and conclusive:

I. On all persons named as parties to the action, and their legal representatives, who have at the time any interest in the property divided, or any part
thereof, as owners in fee or as tenants for life or for years, or as entitled to the
reversion, remainder, or the inheritance of such property, or any part thereof,
after the determination of a particular estate therein, and who by any contingency may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, or who have an
interest in any undivided share thereof, as tenants for years or for life.

2. On all persons interested in the property, who may be unknown, to
whom notice has been given of the action for artition by publication.

3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or persons, or either of
them. And no judgment is invalidated by reason of the death of any party before final judgment or decree; but such judgment or decree is as conclusive
against the heirs, legal representatives or assigns of such decedent, as if it had
been entered before his death.

Sec. I 362. The judgment does not affect tenants for years less than ten, to
the whole of the property which is the subject of the partition.

Sec. I 363. The expenses of the referees, including those of a surveyor and
his assistants, when employed, must be ascertained and allowed by the court,
and the amount thereof, together with the fees allowed by the court, in its
discretion, to the referees, must be apportioned among the different parties to
the action, equitably.

Sec. I 364. When a lien is on an undivided interest or estate of any of the
parties, such lien, if a partition be made, shall thenceforth be a charge only on

the share assigned to such party; but such share must be first charged, with
its just pro ortion of the costs of the partition," in preference to such lien.

Sec. 13 5. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold, if there
be an estate for life or years in an undivided share of the whole property,
such estate may be set off in any part of the property not ordered to be
sold.

Sec. 1366. The proceeds of the sale of incumbered property must be applied
under the direction of the court, as follows :

I. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the action.

2. To pay the costs of the reference.

3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens in their order of priority,
by payment of the sums due and to become due; the amount due to be verified by affidavit at the time of payment.

4. The residue among the owners of the property sold, according to their
respective shares therein.

Sec. 1367. Whenever any party to an action, who holds a lien upon the
property or any part thereof, has other securities for the payment of the amount
of such lien, the court may, in its discretion, order such securities to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or may order a just
deduction to be made from the amount of the lien on the property on account
thereof.

Sec. I 368. The proceeds of sale and the securities taken by the referees, or
any part thereof, must be distributed by them to the persons entitled thereto
whenever the court so directs. But in case no direction be given, all of such
proceeds and securities must be paid into the court, or deposited therein, or as
directed by the court.

Sec. 1369. When the proceeds of the sale of any share or parcel belonging
to persons who are parties to the action and who are known, are paid into the
court, the action may continue as between such parties for the determination
of their respective claims thereto, which must be ascertained and adjudged by
the court. Further testimony may be taken in court, or by a referee, at the
discretion of the court, and the court may, if necessary, require such parties to
present the facts or law in controversy by pleadings, as in an original action.

Sec. 1 370. All sales of real property, made by referees under this Chapter,
must be made at public auction to the highest bidder, upon notice published
in the manner required for the sale of real property on execution. The notice
must state the terms of sale, and if the property or any part of it is to be sold
subject to a prior estate, charge or lien, that must be stated in the notice.

Sec. 1371. The court must, in the order of sale, direct the terms of credit
which may be allowed for the purchase money of any portion of the premises
of which it may direct a sale on credit, and for that portion of which the purchase money is required, by the provisions hereinafter contained, to be invested for the benefit of unknown owners, infants, or parties out of the State.

Sec. 1372. The referees may take separate mortgages and other securities
for the whole, or convenient portions of the purchase money, of such parts of
the property as are directed by the court to be sold on credit, for the shares
of any known owner of full age in the name of such owner; and for the shares
of an infant, in the name of the guardian of such infant; and for the other
shares, in the name of the clerk of the court of the county and his successors in
office. ‘

Sec. I 373. The person entitled to a tenancy for life, or years, or who has a
right or inchoate right of dower, whose estate has been sold, is entitled to receive such sum as may be deemed a reasonable satisfaction for such estate,
and which the person so entitled may consent to accept instead thereof, by an
instrument in writing, filed with the clerk of the court. Upon the filing of
such consent, the clerk must enter the same in the minutes of the court.

Sec. 1374. If such consent be not given, filed and entered, as provided in

the last Section, at or before a judgment of sale is rendered, the court must
ascertain and determine what proportion of the proceeds of the sale, after
deducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable sum to be allowed on
account of such estate, and must order the same to be paid to such party, or
deposited in court for him or her as the case may require.

See. I 375. If the persons entitled to such estate for life or years be unknown,
the court must provide for the protection of their rights, in the same manner,
as far as may be, as if they were known and had appeared.

Sec. I 376. In all cases of sales, when it appears that any person has a
vested or contingent or future right or estate in any of the property sold, the
court must ascertain and settle the proportional value of such contingent
or vested right or estate, and must direct such proportion of the proceeds of
the sale to be invested, secured or paid over, in such manner as to protect the
rights and interests of the parties.

Sec. I 377. In all cases of sales of property the terms must be made known
at the time, and if the premises consist of distinct farms and lots, they must
be sold separately.

Sec. 1378. Neither of the referees, nor any person for the benefit of either
of them, can be interested in any purchase; nor can a guardian of an infant
party be interested in the purchase of any real property being the subject of
the action, except for the benefit of the infant. All sales contrary to the provisions of this Section are void.

Sec. 1379. After completing a sale of the property, or any part thereof
ordered to be sold, the referee must report the same to the court. with a
description of the different parcels of land sold to each purchaser; the price
paid or secured ; the terms and conditions of the sale, and the securities, if any,
taken. The report must be filed in the office of the clerk of _the court and a
certified copy thereof in the office of the county clerk of the county where the
property is situated.

Sec. 1380. If the sale be confirmed by the court, an order must be entered,
directing the referees to execute conveyances and take securities pursuant to
such sale, which they are hereby authorized to do. Such order may also give
directions to them respecting the disposition of the proceeds of the sale.

Sec. I 381. When aparty entitled to ashare of the property, or an encumbrancer entitled to have his lien paid out of the sale, becomes a purchaser, the referees
may take his receipt for so much of the proceeds of the sale as belongs to him.

Sec. 1382. The conveyance must be recorded in the county where the
premises are situated, and shall be a bar against all persons interested in the
property in any way who shall have been named as parties in the action, and
against all such parties and persons as were unknown, if the summons was
served by publication, and against all persons claiming under them, or either of
them, and against all persons having unrecorded deeds or liens at the commencement of the action.

Sec. I 383. Where there are proceeds of a sale belonging to an unknown
owner, or to a person without the State, who has no legal representative
within it, the same must be invested in bonds of this State or the United
States, for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto.

Sec. 1384. When the security of the proceeds of sale is taken, or when an
investment of any such proceeds is made, it must be done, except as herein
otherwise provided, in the name of the clerk of the court where the papers are
filed, and his successors in office, who must hold the same for the use and
benefit of the persons interested, subject to the order of the court.

Sec. 138 5. When security is taken by the referees on a sale, and the
parties interested in such security, by an instrument in writing under their hands,
delivered to the referees, agree upon the shares and proportions to which they
are respectively entitled; or when shares and proportions have been previously
adjudged by the court, such securities must be taken in the names of, and payable to, the parties respectively entitled thereto, and must be delivered to
such parties u on their receipt therefore. Such agreement and receipt must be
returned and led with the clerk of the court.

keep an account in a book provided and kept for that purpose, in the clerk's
office, free for inspection by all persons, of investments and monies received
by him thereon, and the disposition thereof.

Sec. I 387. When it appears that a partition cannot be made equal between
the parties, according to their respective rights, without prejudice to the rights
and interests of some of them, and a partition be ordered, the court may
adjudge compensation to be made by one party to another, on account of the
inequality; but such compensation shall not be required to be made to others
by owners unknown, nor by an infant, unless it appears that such infant has
personal property sulhcient for that purpose, and that his interest will be promoted thereby. And in all cases, the court has power to make compensatory
adjustment between the respective parties, according to the ordinary principles of equity.

Sec. I 388. When the share of an infant is sold, the proceeds of the sale

imposed in him, and will render a true and just account to the person entitled,
or to his legal representative.

Sec. 1390. The general guardian of an infant, andthe guardian entitled to

such infant or other person entitled, and may execute a release, in his behalf,
to the owners of the shares, of the parts to which they may be respectively
entitled, upon an order of the court.

Sec. 1391. Where a party has an existing right of dower in the entire property directed to be sold, at the time when a judgment of partition is rendered,
the court must consider and determine whether the interests of all the parties
require that the right of dower should be excepted from the sale, or that it
should be sold.

Sec. 1392. If a sale of the property, including the right of dower, is directed, the interest of the party entitled to the right of dower shall pass thereby ;
and the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall hold the property free and discharged from any claim by virtue of that right. In that case the dowress is

expended by the plaintifff or either of the defendants for the common benefit,
fees of referees or other disbursements, must by paid by the parties respectively entitled to share in the lands divided in roportion to their respective
interests therein, and may be included and specified in the judgment. In that
case they shall be a lien on the several shares, and the judgment may be enforced, by execution, against such shares and against other property held by
the respective parties. When, however, litigation arises between some of the
parties only, the court may require the expense of such litigation to be paid
by the parties thereto, or any of them.

See. I 395. The court, with the consent of the parties, may appoint a single
referee, instead of three referees, in the proceedings under the provisions of

.this Chapter; and the single referee, when thus appointed, has all the powers

and may perform all the duties required of the three referees.

Sec. 1395. If it appear that other actions or proceedings have been necessarily prosecuted or defended by any one of the tenants in common for the
protection, confirmation, or perfecting of the title, or setting the boundaries, or
making a survey or surveys of the estate partitioned, the court shall allow to
the parties to the action who have paid the expense of such litigation or other
proceedings, all the expenses necessarily incurred therein, except counsel fees,
which shall have accrued to the common benefit of the other tenants in com«
mon, with interest thereon from the date of making the said expenditures, and the
same must be pleaded and allowed by the court and included in the final judgment, and shall be a lien upon the share of each tenant, respectively, in proportion to his interest, and shall be enforced in the same manner as taxable
costs of partiiton are taxed and collected. '

See. I 397. If it appears to the court that it was necessary to have made an
abstract of the title to the property to be partitioned, and such abstract shall
have been procured by the plaintifff, or if the plaintifff shall have failed to have
the same made before the commencement of the action, and any one of the
defendants shall have had such abstract afterward made, the cost of the abstract
with interest thereon from the time the same is subject to the inspection of
the respective parties to the action, must be allowed and taxed. Whenever such abstract is procured by the plaintifff before the commencement
of the action he must file with ‘his complaint a notice that an abstract
of the title has been made, and is subject to the inspection and use of
all the parties to the action, designating therein where the abstract will
be kept for inspection. But if the plaintifff shall have failed to procure
such abstract before commencing the action, and any defendant shall procure
the same to be made, he shall, as soon as he has directed it to be made file
a notice thereof in the action with the clerk of the court, stating who is making
the same and where it will be kept when finished. The court or judge thereof
may direct, from time to time during the progress of the action, who shall
have the custody of the abstract.

Sec. 1398. The abstract mentioned in the last preceding Section may be
made by any competent searcher of records, and need not be certified by the
county clerk or other officer, but instead thereof it must be verified by the
affidavit of the person making it to the effect that he believes it to be correct:
but the same may be corrected, from time to time if found incorrect, under
the direction of the court.

Sec. I 399. Whenever, during the progress of the action for partition, any
disbursements shall have been made under the direction of the court or the
judge thereof by a party thereto, interest must by allowed thereon from the
time of making such disbursements.

order appealed from be fora greater amount than two thousand dollars, and the

severally worth, and judgment may be entered against the sureties by the
court from which the appeal is taken, pursuant to the stipulations herein

Sec. 1727. If the judgment or order appealed from direct the assignment

Sec. 1729. If t e judgment or order appealed from direct the sale or delivery of possession of real property, the execution of the same cannot be stayed,
unless a written underta ing be executed on the part of the appellant, with
two or more sureties, to the effect that during the possession of such property

thereon, and that if the judgment be affirmed or the appeal dismissed, he will
pay the value of the use and occupation of the property from the time of the
appeal until the delivery of the possession thereof, pursuant to the judgment
or order, not exceeding the sum to be fixed by the judge of the court by which
the judgment was rendered or order made, and which must be specified in the
undertaking. When the judgment is for the sale of mortgaged premises, and

Sec. 1730. Whenever an appeal is perfected, as provided in the preceding
Sections of this Chapter, it stays all further proceedings in the court below
upon the judgment or order appealed from, or upon the matters embraced
therein, and releases from levy property which has been levied upon under

any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by the order appealed
from. And the court below may, in its discretion, dispense with or limit the
security required by this Chapter, when the appellant is an executor, administrator, trustee, or other person acting in another’s right. An appeal does not
continue in force on attachment, unless an undertaking be executed and filed
on the part of the appellant, by at least two sureties, in double of the amount
of the debt claimed by him, that the appellant will pay all costs and damages

order of the court belowbesustained, and unless, within five days after the entry

justify as required by Section 1899, of this Code.

thereof, upon five days’ notice to the respondent of the time and place of
justification, execution of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from is no
longer stayed; and in all cases where an undertaking is required on appeal by

judgment or order appealed from, except where it directs the sale of perishable
property, in which case the court below may order the property to be sold and
the proceeds thereof to be deposited, to abide the judgment of the appellate

court. And except also, where it adjudges the defendant guilty of usurping, or
intruding into, or unlawfully holding public office, civil or military, within this
State. Also except where a judgment grants a writ of mandamus, or of prohibition, against a tribunal, corporation, public officer or board, commanding

ought not to be done by such tribunal, corporation, public officer or board,
and not involvin the payment or allowance of money or its equivalent.

or guardian, his official bond shall stand in the place of an undertaking on
appeal; and his sureties thereon shall be liable as on such undertaking.

Sec. 1735. When the judgment or order appointing an executor, or administrator, or guardian, is reversed on appeal, for error, and not for want of jurisdiction of the court, all lawful acts in administration upon the estate performed
by such executor or administrator, or guardian, if he have qualified, are as valid
as if such judgment or order had been affirmed. _ '

Sec. 1736. On an appeal from a fmal judgment, the appellant must furnish
the court with a copy of the notice of appeal, of the judgment roll, and of any
bill of exceptions or statement in the case, upon which the appellant relies.

final judgment equally as upon appeal from the order granting or refusing a
new trial.

See. 1737. On appeal from an order, except an order granting or refusing a
new trial, the appellant must furnish the court with a copy of the notice of
appeal of the judgment or order appealed from, and of papers used on the hearing in the court below.

appellant must furnish the court with a copy of the notice of appeal, of the
order appealed from, and of the papers designated in Section 1176, of this Code.

Sec. 1739. The copies provided for in the last three Sections must be certilied to be correct by the clerk or the attorneys, and must be accompanied with
a certificate of the clerk or attorneys that an undertaking on appeal, in due
form, has been properly filed, or the stipulation of the parties waiving an
undertaking.

Sec. 1740. If the appellant fails to furnish the requisite papers, the appeal
may be dismissed; but no appeal can be dismissed for insufficiency of the
undertaking thereon, if a good and sufficient undertaking approved by a justice
of the Supreme Court, be filed in the Supreme Court before the hearing upon
motion to dismiss the appeal.

Sec. 1741. The dismissal of an appeal is in effect an afiirmance of the judgment or order appealed from, unless the dismissal is expressly made without
prejudice to another appeal.

Sec. 1742. Upon an appeal from a judgment, the court may review the verdict or decision, and any intermediate order or decision excepted to, which
involves the merits, or necessarily affects the judgment, except a decision or
order from which an appeal might have been taken.

Sec. 1743. When the judgment or order is reversed, or modified, the
appellate court may make complete restitution of all property and rights lost
by the erroneous judgment or order, so far as such restitution is consistent
with protection of a purchaser of property at a sale ordered by the judgment,
or had under process issued upon the judgment, on the appeal from which the
proceedings were not stayed, and for relief in such cases the appellant may
have his action against the respondent, enforcing the judgment for the proceeds of the sale of the property, after deducting therefrom the expenses of
the sale. When it appears to the appellate court that the appeal was made
for delay, it may add to the costs such damages as may be just.

Sec. 1744. When judgment is rendered upon the appeal, it must be certified by the clerk of the Supreme Court to the clerk with whom the jud ment
roll is filed, or the order appealed from is entered. In cases of appe from
the judgment, the clerk with whom the roll is filed must attach the certificate
to the judgment roll, and enter a minute of the judgment of the Supreme
Court on the docket against the original entry. In cases of appeal from- an
order, the clerk must enter at length in the records of the court, the certificate
received, and minute against the entry of the order appealed from, a reference
to the certificate, with a brief statement that such order has been affirmed,
reversed or modified by the Supreme Court on appeal.

1764. E ect o a peal.

I  my 0 proceedings on filing undertaking.

17 . Powers of District Court on appeal.

I767. Defective undertaking.

Sec. 1760. Any party dissatisfied with a judgment rendered in acivil action
in a police or justice’s court, may appeal therefrom to the District Court of
the county, at any time within thirty days after the rendition of the judgment.
The appeal is taken by liling a notice of appeal with the justice or judge, and
serving a copy on the adverse party or his attorney.

Sec. 1761. All appeals from justices‘ or police courts must be tried anew
in the District Court, on the papers filed in the justice’s or police court, unless
the court, for good cause shown, and on such terms as may be just, allow other
or amended pleadings to be filed in such action. The court may order new or
amended pleadings to'be filed. Each party has the benefit of all legal objections made in a justice’s or police court. When a judgment is reversed or set
aside on a question of law arising in the justice’s or police court, the District
Court must either try the case anew or render a judgment. There is no appeal from a judgment by default rendered in a justice’s or police court, except
on questions of law which appear on the face of the papers or proceedings, and
except in cases when the justices or police court has abused its discretion in
setting aside or refusing to set aside a default or judgment. If the judgment
by default is set aside, the District Court must allow pleadings to be filed and
try the case.

Sec. 1762. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, and tiling an undertaking
as required in the next Section, the justice or judge must, within ten days,
upon the payment of the fees therefore, transmit to the clerk of the District .
Court a certified copy of his docket, the pleadings, all notices, motions and
other papers filed in the cause, the notice of appeal, and the undertaking filed;
and the justice or judge may be compelled by the District Court, by an order
entered upon motion, to transmit such papers, and may be lined for neglect or
refusal to transmit the same. A certified copy of such order may be served
on the justice or judge by the party or his attorney.

Sec. 1763. An appeal from a justice’s or police court is not effectual for any
purpose unless an undertaking be filed, with two or more sureties, in a sum
equal to twice the amount of the judgment, including costs. when the judgment is for the payment of money; or twice the value of the property, including costs, when the judgment is for the recovery of specific personal property,
and must be conditioned, when the action is for the recovery of money, that
the appellant will pay the amount of the judgment appealed from, and all costs,
if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or the amount of any judgment and

all costs that may be recovered against him in the action in the District
Court. When the action is for the recovery of specific personal property, the
undertaking must be conditioned that the appellant will pay the judgment and
costs appealed from, and obey the order of the court made therein, if the
appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or any judgment and costs that may be
recovered against him in said action in the District Court, and will obey any
order made by the court therein. When the judgment appealed from directs
the delivery of possession of real property, the execution of the same cannot
be stayed unless a written undertaking be executed on the part of the appellant, with two or more sureties, to the effect that during the possession of such
property by the appellant, he will not commit, or suffer to be committed, any
waste thereon, and that if the appeal be dismissed or withdrawn, or the judgment affirmed, or judgment be recovered against him in the action in the District Court, he will pay the value of the use and occupation of the property
from the time of the appeal until the delivery of possession thereof; or that he
will pay any judgment and costs that may be recovered against him in said
action in the District Court, not exceeding a sum to be fixed by the justice of
the court from which the appeal is taken, and which sum must be specified in
the undertaking. A deposit of the amount of the judgment, including all
costs appealed from, or of the value of the property, including all costs in
actions for the recovery of specific personal property, with the justice or judge,
is equivalent to the filing of the undertaking, and in such cases the justice or
judge must transmit the money to the clerk of the District Court, to be by
him paid out on the order of the court. The adverse party may except to the
sufficiency of the sureties within five days after the filing of the undertaking,
and unless they or other sureties justify before the justice or judge within five
days thereafter, upon notice to the adverse party, to the amounts stated in
their affidavits, the appeal must be regarded as if no such undertaking had been
given.

Sec. 1764. If the party in whose favor the judgment is rendered appeals,
the undertaking must be in the sum of one hundred dollars, and conditioned
that he will pay all costs that may be awarded against him, and obey any
order of court made in the action. If the party appealing fails to reduce the
judgment against him, or to enlarge the judgment in his favor appealed from,
ten dollars or more, or reverse the same in the District Court, he shall not recover any costs of appeal. The sureties on the undertaking mentioned in this
and the preceding Sections, must justify as provided in Section 1899.

See. 1765. If an execution be issued, on the filing of the undertaking, the
justice or judge must direct the officer to stay all proceedings on the same.
Such officer must, upon the payment of his fees for services rendered on the
execution, thereupon relinquish all property levied upon. and deliver the
same to the judgment debtor. together with all monies collected from sales
or otherwise. If his fees on the execution be not paid, the officer may retain
so much of the property or proceeds thereof as may be necessary to pay the
same.

Sec. 1766. When the action is tried anew on appeal, the trial must be conducted in all respects as other trials in the District Court. The provisions of
this Code as to trials in the District Court, are applicable to trials on appeal in
the District Court. For a failure to prosecute an appeal, or unnecessary delay
in bringing it to a hearing. the District Court may order the appeal to be dismissed, with costs; and if it appear to such court that the appeal was made
solely for delay, it may add to the costs such damages as may be just, not exceeding twenty-five per cent. of the judgment appealed from. Judgments
rendered in the District Court on appeal shall have the same force and effect,
and may be enforced in the same manner, as judgments in actions commenced
in the District Court.

Sec. 1767. No appeal shall be dismissed for insufficiency of the undertaking

thereon, or for any defect or irregularity therein, if a good and sufficient undertaking be filed in the District Court at or before the hearing of the motion to
dismiss the appeal, which undertaking must be approved by the district judge.

Section 1780. Parties not snmmoned on action on joint contract may be snmmoned after
fndgment.

I781. Summons in tbat case, robot to contain, and bow served.

1782. Afdavit to accomfany snmmons.

1785. Issues, bow tried. Verdict, win! to be.

1786. yoint debtor may comfromise.

1787. Eject of disckarge of debtor. Contribution.

Sec. 1780. When a judgment is recovered against one or more of several
persons, jointly indebted upon an obligation, by proceeding, as provided in
Section 641, those who are not originally served with the summons, and did
not appear to the action, may be summoned to show cause why they should
not be bound by the judgment in the same manner as though they had been
originally served with the summons.

Sec. 1781. The summons, as provided in the last Section, must describe the
judgment, and require the person summoned to show cause why he should not
be bound by it, and must be served in the same manner and returnable within
the same time as the original summons. It is not necessary to file a new
complaint.

‘ Sec. 1782. The summons must be accompanied by an affidavit of the
plaintifff, his agent, representative or attorney, that the judgment, or some part
thereof, remains unsatisfied, and must specify the amount due thereon.

Sec. 1783. Upon such summons, the defendant may answer within the
time specified therein, denying the judgment or setting up any defense which
may have arisen subsequently; or he may deny his liability on the obligation
upon which the judgment was recovered, except adischarge from such liability
by the Statute of Limitations.

Sec. I 784. If the defendant, in his answer, deny the judgment, or set up
any defense which may have arisen subsequently, the summons with the affidavit annexed, and the answer, constitute the written allegations in the case;
if he deny his liability on the obligation upon which the judgment was
recovered, a copy of the original complaint and judgment, the summons, with
the affidavit annexed, and the answer, constitute such written allegations.

Sec. 1785. The issues formed may be tried as in other cases, but when the
defendant denies in his answer, any liability on the obligation upon which the
judgment was rendered, if a verdict be found against him it must be for not
exceeding the amount remaining unsatisfied on such original judgment, with
interest thereon.

Sec. I 786. Any joint debtor including a partner may compromise with a
creditor, and a discharge to him by such creditor, is as effectual as if made to

all debtors, but such discharge does not relieve the other joint debtors. Any
creditor can release a judgment in his favor against any one or more joint
debtors, and such release does not discharge the others.

Sec. 1787. The discharge of such joint debtor operates as a payment to the
creditor equal to the proportionate interest of the debtor discharged. But the
discharge of such debtor does not prevent his co-debtors from enforcing the
right of contribution in case they are compelled to pay the whole of the debt.

CHAPTER II.
OFFER or THE DEFENDANT TO COMPROMISE.

Section 1800. Proceedings on qfer of tie defendant to compromise after suit brougkt.

Sec. 1800. The defendant may, at any time before the trial or judgment,
serve upon the plaintifff an offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for
the sum or property, or to the effect therein specified. If the plaintifff accept

. Sec. 2010. Any elector of a county, town or city, or of any political subdivision of either, may contest the right of any person declared to be elected
to an office to be exercised therein, for any of the following causes:

1. For malconduct on the part of the Board of Judges, or any member
thereof.

2. When the person whose right to the office is contested was not, at the
time of the election, eligible to such office.
. 3. When the person whose right is contested has given to any elector or
inspector, Judge or clerk of the election, any bribe or reward, or has offered any
such bribe or reward for the purpose of procuring his election, or has committed any_ other offense against the elective franchise, defined in Title IV.,
Part I., of the Penal Code.

4. On account of illegal votes.

Sec. 2011. No irregularity or improper conduct in the proceedings of the
judges, or any of them, is such malconduct as avoids an election, unless irregularity or improper conduct is such as to procure the person whose right to the
office is contested to be declared elected, when he had not received the highest
number of legal votes.

Sec. 2012. When any election held for an office exercised in and for a county
is contested on account of any malconduct on the part of the Board of Judges
of any election district or precinct, or any member thereof, the election cannot

vote of such district or precinct would change the result as to such office in the
remaining vote of the county.

Sec. 2013. Nothing in the fourth ground of contest, specified in Section
2010, is to be so construed as to authorize an election to be set aside on
account of illegal votes, unless it appear that a number of illegal votes has been
given to the person whose right to the office is contested, which if taken from
him, would reduce the number’ of his legal votes below the number of votes
given to some other person for the same office, after deducting therefrom the
illegal votes which may be shown to have been given to such other person.

Sec. 2014. When an elector contests the right of any person declared elected to such office, he must, within twenty days after the canvassers have made
their return of the election, file with the clerk of the District Court of the
county in which the contest arises a written statement, setting forth specifically:

1. The name of the party contesting such election, and that he is an elector of the district, county or township, as the case may be, in which such election was held. '

2. The name of the person whose right to the office is contested.

3. The office. '

4. The particular grounds of such contest.

Which statement must be verified by the affidavit of the contesting party
that the matters and things therein contained are true.

Sec. 2015. When the reception of illegal votes is alleged as a cause of
contest, it is sufficient to state generally that in one or more specilied voting
precincts illegal votes were given to the person whose election is contested,
which, if taken from him, will reduce the number of his legal votes below the
number of legal votes given to some other person for the same office; but no
testimony can be received of any illegal votes, unless the party contesting such
election deliver to the opposite party, at least three days before such trial, a
written list of the number of illegal votes, and by whom given, which he intends to prove on such trial; and no testimony can be received of any illegal
votes except such as are specified in such list.

Sec. 2016. No statement of the grounds of contest will be rejected, nor the
proceedings dismissed by any court for want of form, if the grounds of contest
are alleged with such certainty as will advise the defendant of the particular
proceeding or cause for which such election is contested.

Sec. 2017. Upon the statement being filed, the clerk must inform the
District Court or judge of the county thereof, which shall thereupon order a
special session or term of such court to be held at the court room, on some day
to be named by it, not less than ten nor more than twenty days from the date
of such order, to hear and determine such contested election.

Sec. 2018. The clerk shall thereupon issue a citation for the person, whose
right to the office is contested, to appear at the time and place specified in the
order, which citation must be delivered to the sheriH, and served either upon
the party in person, or if he cannot be found, by leaving a copy thereof at the
house where he last resided, at least five days before the time so specified.

Sec. 2019. The clerk must issue subpoenas for witnesses at the request
of either party, which must be served as other subpoenas; and the District

Court shall have full power to issue attachments to compel attendance of witnesses who have been subpaened to attend.

Sec. 2020. The court must meet at the time and place designated, to determine such contested election, and shall have all the powers necessary to the
determination thereof. It may adjourn from day to day until such trial is
ended, and may also continue the trial, before its commencement, for any
time not exceeding twenty days, for good cause shown by either party upon
affidavit, at the cost of the party applying for such continuance.

Sec. 2021. The court must be governed, in the trial and determination of
such contested election, by the rules of law and evidence governing the determination of questions of law and fact, so far as the same may be applicable;
and may dismiss the proceedings if the statement of the cause or causes of the
contest is insufficient, or for want of prosecution. After hearing the proofs
and allegations of the parties, the court must pronounce judgment in the
premises,either confirming or annulling and setting aside such election.

Sec. 2022. If in any such case it appears that another person than the one
returned has the highest number of legal votes, the court must declare such
person elected.

Sec. 2023. If the proceedings are dismissed for insufficiency, or want of
prosecution, or the election is by the court confirmed, judgment must be
rendered against the party contesting such election, for costs, in favor of the
party whose election was contested; but if the election is annulled or set aside,
judgment for costs must be rendered against the party whose election was
contested, in favor of the party contesting the same. Primarily, each party is
liable for the costs created by himself, to the officers and witnesses entitled
thereto, which may be collected in the same manner as similar costs are collected in other cases.

Sec. 2024'. Either party, aggrieved by the judgment of the court may
appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court, as in other cases of appeal thereto
from the District Court, but such appeal must not stay execution or proceedings, except execution for costs. Sec. 2025. Whenever an election is annulled or set aside by the judgment
of the District Court, and no appeal has been taken within ten days thereafter,
the commission, if any has issued, is void, and the office vacant.

Sec. 2062. Such notice must be served upon the plaintifff, his agent or attorney, one day at least before the hearing of the application.

be taken before the judge, who must examine him under oath concerning his
estate and property and effects, and the disposal thereof, and his ability to pay
the judgment for which he is committed; and such judge may also hear any
other legal or pertinent evidence that may be produced by the debtor or the
creditor.

Sec. 2064. The plaintifff in the action may, upon such examination, propose
to the prisoner any such interrogatories pertinent to the inquiry ; and they
must, if required by him, be proposed and answered in writing, and the answer must be signed and sworn to by the prisoner.

is entitled to his discharge, he must administer to him the following oath, towit: “I, , do solemnly swear that I have not any estate, real or
personal, to the amount of fifty dollars, except such as is by law exempted
from being taken in execution ; and that I have not any other estate now conveyed or concealed, or in any way disposed of, with design to secure the same

arrest or imprisonment for the same debt, unless he be convicted of having
willfully sworn falsely upon his examination before the judge, or in taking the
oath before prescribed.

to be discharged, and he is not thereafter liable to imprisonment for the same
cause of action. Sec. 2071. Whenevera prisoner is committed to jail on an execution issued

successive week of his imprisonment, and in case of failure to do so, the jailer
must forthwith discharge such prisoner from custody; and such discharge has
the same effect as if made by order of the creditor.

actual occupation of the premises, also upon such sub-tenant. Such notice
may be served at any time within one year after the rent becomes due. In all
cases of tenancy upon agricultural lands, where the tenant has held over and
retained possession for more than sixty days after the expiration of his term
without any demand of possession or notice to quit by the landlord, or the
successor in estate of "his landlord, if any there be, he shall be deemed to be holding by permission of the landlord or the successor in estate of his landlord, and
shall be entitled to hold under the terms of the lease for another full year, and
shall not be guilty of an unlawful detainer during said ytar, and such holding
over for the period aforesaid shall be taken and construed as a consent on the
part of a tenant to hold for another year.

3. When he continues in possession, in person or by sub-tenant, after a
neglect or failure to perform other conditions or covenants of the lease or

agreement under which the property is held, including any covenant not to
assign or sub-let, than the one for the payment of rent, and three days’ notice,
in writing, requiring the performance of such conditions or covenants, or the
possession of the property, shall have been served upon him, and if there be a
sub-tenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such sub-tenant.
Within three days after the serving of the notice, the tenant, or any sub-tenant
in actual occupation of the premises, or any mortgagee of the term, or other
person interested in its continuance, may perform the conditions or covenants
of the lease, or pay the stipulated rent, as the case may be, and thereby save
the lease from forfeiture. If the covenants and conditions of the lease, violated
by the lessee, cannot afterward be performed, then no notice, as last prescribed
herein, need be given to said lessee or his sub-tenant demanding the performance of the violated covenant or conditions of the lease. A tenant may take
proceedings, similar to those prescribed in this Chapter, to obtain possession
of the premises let to an under-tenant, in case of his unlawful detention of the
premises under-let to him.

4. Any tenant or sub-tenant, assigning or sub-letting, or committing waste
upon the demised premises, contrary to the covenants of his lease, thereby
terminates the lease, and the landlord, or his successor in estate, shall upon
service of three days’ notice to quit, upon the person or persons in possession,
be entitled to restitution of possession of such demised premises, under the
provisions of this Chapter.

Sec. 2083. The notices required by the preceding Section may be served,
either:

1. By delivering a copy to the tenant personally ; or,

2. If he be absent from his place of residence, and from his usual place of
business, by leaving a copy with some person of suitable age and discretion at
either place, and sending a copy through the mail addressed to the tenant at
his place of residence ; or,

3. If such place of residence and business cannot be ascertained, or a person of suitable age or discretion there cannot be found, then by affixing a copy
in a conspicuous place on the property, and also delivering a copy to a person
there residing, if such person can be found ; and also sending a copy through
the mail addressed to the tenant at the place where the property is situated.
Service upon a sub-tenant may be made in this same manner.

Sec. 2084. The District Court of the county in which the property, or
some part of it, is situated, shall have jurisdiction of proceedings under this
Chapter; provided, that justices’ courts, within their respective towns, townships or cities, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.

Sec. 2085. No person other than the tenant of the premises and sub-tenant,
if there be one, in the actual occupation of the premises when the complaint is
filed, need be made parties defendant in the proceeding, nor shall any proceeding abate, nor the plaintifff be non-suited for the non-joinder of any person who
might have been made party defendant; but when it appears that any of the
parties served with process, or appearing in the proceeding, are guilty of the
o&'ense charged, judgment must be rendered against him. In case a defendant
has become a sub-tenant of the premises- in controversy, after the service of
the notice provided for by Part 2., of Section 2082, of this Code, upon the
tenant of the premises, the fact that such notice was not served on each subtenant, shall constitute no defense to the action. In case a married woman be
a tenant, or a sub-tenant, her coverture shall constitute no defense ; but in case
her husband be not joined, or unless she has separate property, an execution
issued upon a personal judgment against her can only be enforced against
property on the premises at the commencement of the action, or against her
separate property. All persons who enter the premises under the tenant, after
the commencement of the action, shall be bound by the judgment the sameas
if he or they had been made party to the action.

Sec. 2086. Except as provided in the preceding Section, the provisions of
Part II., of this Code, relating to parties to civil actions, are applicable to this
proceeding.

Sec. 2087. The plaintifff, in his complaint, which must be in writing, must
set forth the facts on which he seeks to recover, and describe the premises with
reasonable certainty, and may set forth therein any circumstances of fraud,
force or violence, which may have accompanied the alleged forcible entry, or
forcible or unlawful detainer, and claim damages therefore. In case the unlawful detainer charged be after default in the payment of rent, the complaint
must state the amount of such rent. Upon filing the complaint, a summons
must be issued thereon as in_ other cases, returnable at a date designated therein,
which shall not be less than four days nor more than twelve days from its date.
The summons must be served personally upon the defendants, if within the
State; if not within the State, in the same manner as notices are required to
be served in Section 2083. The complaint need not be served.

Sec. 2088. The summons must state the parties to the proceeding, the court
in which the same is brought, the nature of the action, in concise terms, and
the relief sought, and also the return day, and must notify the defendant to
appear and answer within the time designated, or that the relief sought will be
taken against him. The summons must be directed to the defendant, and be
served at least four days before the return day designated therein, and must
be served and returned in the same manner as summons in civil actions is
served and returned. Upon the return of any summons issued under this
Chapter, where the same has not, for any reason, been served or not served in
time, the plaintifff may have a new summons issued, the same as if no previous
summons had been issued.

Sec. 2089. If, at the time appointed, the defendant does not appear and
defend, the court must enter his default, and enter judgment in favor of the
plaintifff, as prayed for in the complaint.

Sec. 2090. On or before the day fixed for his appearance, the defendant
may appear and answer or demur.

Sec.’ 2091. Whenever an issue of fact is presented by the pleadings, it must
be tried by a jury, unless such jury be waived as in other cases. The jury
shall be formed in the same manner as other trial juries in the court in which
the action is pending.

Sec. 2092. On the trial of any proceedings for any forcible entry or forcible
detainer, the plaintifff shall only be required to show, in addition to the forcible
entry or forcible detainer complained of, that he was peaceably in the actual
possession at the time of the forcible entry, or, was entitled to the possession
at the time of the forcible detainer. The defendant may show in his defense,
that he or his ancestors, or those whose interest in such premises he claims,
have been in the quiet possession thereof for the space of one whole year together next before the commencement of the proceedings, and that his interest
therein is not then ended or determined, and such showing is a bar to the
proceedings.

Sec. 2093. When, upon the trial of any proceeding under this Chapter, it
appears from the evidence that the defendant has been guilty of either forcible
entry or a forcible or unlawful detainer, and other than the offense charged in
the complaint, the judge must order that such complaint be forthwith amended
to conform with such proof; such amendment must be made without any imposition of terms. No continuance shall be permitted on account of such
amendment, unless the defendant, by affidavit filed, shows to the satisfaction
of the court good cause therefore.

Sec. 2094. If, upon the trial, the verdict of the jury, or, if the case be tried
without a jury, the finding of the court be in favor of the plaintifff and against
the defendant, judgment shall be entered for the restitution of the premises;
and if the proceeding be for an unlawful detainer after neglect or failure to

perform the conditions or covenants of the lease or agreement under which the
property is held, or after default in the payment of rent, the judgment shall
also declare the forfeiture of such lease or agreement. The jury, or the court,
if the proceeding be tried without a jury, shall also assess the damages occasioned to the plaintifff by any forcible entry, or by any forcible or unlawful
detainer, alleged in the complaint and proved on the trial, and fund the amount
of any rent due, if the alleged unlawful detainer be after default in the payment
of rent ; and the judgment shall be rendered against the defendant, guilty of
the forcible entry, or forcible or unlawful detainer, for three times the amount
of the damages thus assessed, and of the rent found due. When the proceeding is for an unlawful detainer after default in the payment of the rent, and the
lease or agreement under which the rent is payable, has not by its terms expired,
execution upon the judgment shall not be issued until the expiration of five
days after the entry of the judgment, within which time the tenant, or any subtenant, or any mortgagee of the term, or other party interested in its continuance, may pay into court, for the landlord, the amount found due as rent, with
interest thereon and the amount of damages found by the jury or the court for
the unlawful detainer, and the costs of the proceeding, and thereupon the judgment shall be satisfied and the tenant be restored to his estate; but if payment,
as here provided, be not made within the five days, the judgment may be
enforced for its full amount, and for the possession of the premises. In all
other cases the judgment may be enforced immediately.

Sec. 2095. The complaint and answer must be verified. If new matter be
set up in the answer it is deemed denied.

Sec. 2096. An appeal may be taken by plaintifff or defendant as in other
cuw.

Sec. 2097. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, provisions of
Part II., of this Code, are applicable to, and constitute the rules of practice

and restore him to his former estate in case of hardship, where application for
such relief is made within thirty days after the forfeiture is declared by the
judgment of the court, as provided in Section 2094, The application may be
made by a tenant or sub-tenant, or mortgagee of the term, or any person interested in the continuance of the term. It must be made upon petition, setting
forth the facts upon which relief is sought, and be verified by the applicant.
Notice of the application, with a copy of the petition, must be served on the
plaintifff in the judgment, who may appear and contest the application. In
no case shall the application be granted except on condition that full payment of rent due, or full performance of conditions or covenants stipulated, so
far as the same is practicable, be made.

possession, as provided in Section 2229, the compensation and damages
awarded shall draw lawful interest from the date of such order. No improvements put upon the property subsequent to the date of the service of summons

action on such bond, the plaintifff may recover reasonable attorney's fees.

Sec. 2227. Payment may be made to the defendants entitled thereto, or the
money may be deposited in court for the defendants, and be distributed to
those entitled thereto. If the money be not so paid or deposited, the defendants may have execution as in civil cases, and if the money cannot be made on

and annul the entire proceedings and restore possession of the property to the
defendant, if possession has been taken by the plaintifff.

Sec. 2228. When payments have been made, and the bond given, if the
plaintifff elects to give one, as required by the last two Sections, the court or
judge must make a final order of condemnation, which must describe the property condemned, and the purposes of such condemnation. A copy of the order must be filed in the office of the county clerk, and thereupon the property
described therein shall vest in the plaintifff for the purposes therein specified.

Sec. 2229. At any time after the report and assessment of damages of the
commissioners has been made and filed in the court, and either before or after
appeal from such assessment or from any other order or judgment in the proceedings, the court or any judge thereof at chambers, upon application of the

plaintifff be authorized to take possession of such property and use and possess
the same during the pendency and until the final conclusion of the proceedings
and litigation, and that all actions and proceedings against the plaintifff on account thereof be stayed until such time; provided, however, that where an appeal is taken by such defendant, the court or judge may in its or his discretion
require the plaintifff, before continuing or taking such possession, in addition
to paying into court the amount of damages assessed, to give bond or undertaking, with sufficient sureties, to be approved by the judge and to be in such
sum as the court or judge may direct, conditioned to pay defendant any additional damages and .costs over and above the amount assessed, which it may
finally be determined that defendant is entitled to for the appropriation of the

property, and all damages which defendant may sustain, if for any cause such
property shall not be finally taken for public uses. The amount assessed as
damages by the commissioners or by the jury on appeal, as the case may be, shall
be taken and considered, for the purposes of this Section, until re-assessed or
changed in the further proceedings, as just compensation for the property ap.
propriated; but the plaintifff, by payment into court of the amount assessed,
or by giving security as above provided, shall not be thereby prevented or
precluded from appealing from such assessment, but may appeal in the same
manner and with the same effect as if no money had been deposited or security given; and in all cases where the plaintifff deposits the amount of the
assessment and continues in possession or takes possession of the property as
herein provided, the defendant entitled thereto, if there be no dispute as to
the ownership of the property, may at any time demand and receive from the
court the money so deposited, and shall not by such demand or receipt be
barred or concluded from his right of appeal from such assessment, but may,
notwithstanding, take and prosecute his appeal from such assessment; provided, that if the amount of such assessment is finally reduced on appeal by
either party, such defendant who has received the amount of the assessment
deposited shall be liable to the plaintifff for any excess of the amount so received by him over the amount finally assessed, with legal interest on such excess from the time such defendant received the money deposited, and the
same may be recovered by action ; and, provided further, that upon any appeal
from assessment of damages by the commissioners to a jury, the jury may find
as compensation or damages a less as well as an equal or greater amount than
that assessed by the commissioners.

(Sec. 2229. Act approved Much nth. 1895.)

Sec. 2230. Costs may be allowed or not, and if allowed may be apportioned between the parties on the same or adverse sides, in the discretion of

the court.

situated, setting forth a description of the estate, the name of the person last
seized, the name of the occupant and person claiming such estate, if known,
and the facts and circumstances in consequence of which the estate is claimed
to have escheated, with an allegation that, by reason thereof the State of
Montana has right by law to such estate. Upon such information a summons

must issue to such person, requiring him to appear and answer the information within the time allowed by law in civil actions; and the court must make
an order setting forth briefly the contents of the information, and requiring all
persons interested in the estate to appear and show cause, if any they have,
within forty days from date of the order, why the same should not vest in this
State, which order must be published for at least one month from the date
thereof, in a newspaper published in the county, if one be published therein,
and in case no newspaper is published in the county, in some other newspaper
in this State.

Sec. 22 51. The court or judge, upon the information being filed and upon
the application of the Attorney General, either before or after answer, upon notice to the party claiming such estate, if known, may, upon sufficient cause

Sec. 2252. All persons named in the information may appear and answer,
and may traverse or deny the facts stated in the information, and the title of
the State to lands and tenements therein mentioned, at any time before the
time of answering expires, and any other person claiming an interest in such
estate may appear and be made a defendant, and by motion for that purpose
in open court within the time allowed for answering; and if no person appears
and answers within the time, then judgment must be rendered, that the State
be seized of the lands and tenements in such information claimed. But if any
person appear and deny the title set up by the State, or traverse any material
fact set forth in the information, the issue of fact must be tried as issues of
facts are tried in civil actions. If, after the issues are tried, it appears from
the facts found or admitted that the State has good title to the lands and tenements in the information mentioned, or any part thereof, judgment must be
rendered that the State be seized thereof, and recover costs of suit against the
defendants. In any judgment rendered, or that has been heretofore rendered
by any court of competent jurisdiction, escheating real property to the State,
on motion of the Attorney General, the court or judge shall make an order that
said real property be sold by the sheriff of the county where the same is situate, at public sale, after giving such notice of the time and place of sale as may
be prescribed by the court or judge in said order; that the sheriff shall, within
five days after such sale, make a report thereof to the court, and upon the hearing of the said report, the court or judge may examine the said witnesses in

notice must be given, and the sale in all respects conducted as if no previous
sale had taken place. If an offer of ten per cent. more in amount than that
named in the report be made to the court in writing by a responsible person,
the court or judge, may, in its or his discretion, accept such offer, and confirm
the sale to such person, or order a new sale. If it appears to the court or
judge that the sale was legally made, and fairly conducted, and that the sum
bid is not disproportionate to the value of the property sold, and that a greater
sum than ten per cent., exclusive of the expense of a new sale, cannot be
obtained, or if the increased bid above mentioned be made and accepted by the
court, the court or judge must make an order confirming the sale, and directing the sheriff, in the name of the State, to execute to purchaser or purchasers
a conveyance of said property sold; and said conveyance shall vest in the purchaser or purchasers all the right and title of the State therein, and the sheriff
shall, out of the proceeds of such sale, pay the cost of said proceedings incurred
on behalf of the State, including the expenses of making such sale, and also

person interested in the estate, may, at any time after the death of the testator, petition the court having jurisdiction to have the will proved, whether the

he has knowledge of the death of the testator, and that he is named as executor, fails to petition to the proper court for the probate of the will, and that

right to letters, and the court or judge may appoint any other competent
person administrator, unless good cause for delay is shown.

Sec. 2324. If it is alleged in any petition that any will is in the possession
of a third person, and the court or judge is satisfied that the allegation is correct, an order must be issued and served upon the person having possession of

different days of publication; and if in a newspaper published oftener than

legatees, or heirs of an estate may contest the will through their guardians, or

bar a contest after probate by the party so represented if commenced within

wi 1.

of the hand-writing of the testator and of the subscribing witnesses, or any of
them.

citation to issue requiring such sureties to appear before him at a designated
time and place, to be examined touching their property and its value ; and the
judge must, at the same time, cause a notice to be issued to the executor or
administrator requiring his appearance on the return of the citation; and on

required of the executor, letters testamentary may issue, and sales of real

afterward, if it appear from any cause necessary or proper, be required to file
a bond, as in other cases.

the bond is insufiicient, and ask that further security be required.

Sec. 2481. If the court or judge is satisfied that the matter requires investigation, a citation must be issued to the executor or administrator, requiring
him to appear, at a time and place therein specified, to show cause why he
should not give further security. The citation must be served personally on

at his place of residence, or by such publication as the court or judge may
order.

may appoint, he must proceed to hear the proofs and allegations of the parties.

than five days. ° ‘

by order, suspend his powers until the matter can be heard and determined.

Sec. 2485. Whenit comes to his knowledge that the bond of any executor

give further security, and must proceed thereon as upon the application of any
person interested.

Sec. 2486. When a surety of any executor or administrator desires to be released from responsibility on account of future acts, he may make application
to the court or judge for relief. The court or judge must cause a citation to

the executor or administrator to be issued and served personally, requiring him
to appear at a time and place to be therein specified, and to give other security.

after due diligence and inquiry, service may be had as provided in Section
248:.

Sec. 2487. If new sureties be given to the satisfaction of the judge, he may
thereupon make an order that the sureties who applied for relief shall not be
liable on their bond for any subsequent act, default, or misconduct of the
executor or administrator.

Sec. 2488. If the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to give new
sureties, to the satisfaction of the judge, on the return of the citation, or

Sec. 2550. Every executor or administrator must make and return to the
court, within three months after his appointment, a true inventory and appraisement of all the estate of the decedent, including the homestead, if any, which
has come to his possession or knowledge.

Sec. 2551. To make the appraisement the court or judge must appoint three

disinterested persons, any two of whom may act, who are entitled to receive a
reasonable compensation for their services, not to exceed five dollars per day,
to be allowed by the court or judge. The appraisers must, with the inventory,
file a verified account of their services and disbursements; if only one day's
service is charged the account need not be verified. If any part of the estate
is in any other county than that in which letters issued, appraisers thereof may
be appointed by the District Court or judge having jurisdiction of the estate,
or by the District Court or judge of such other county, on request of the court
or judge having jurisdiction.

Sec. 2552. Before proceeding to the execution of their duty, the appraisers,
before any officer authorized to administer oaths, must take and subscribe an
oath, to be attached to the inventory, that they will truely, honestly and
impartially appraise the property exhibited to them, according to the best of
their knowledge and ability. They must then proceed to estimate and appraise
the property; each article must be set down separately, with the value thereof
in dollars and cents, in figures, opposite to the articles, respectively; the inventory must contain all the estate of the decedent, real and personal, a statement of all debts, partnerships, and other interests, bonds, mortgages, notes,
and other securities for the payment of money belonging to the decedent, specifying the name of the debtor in each security, the date, the sum originally
payable, the indorsements thereon, if any, with their dates, and the sum which,
in the judgment of the appraisers, may be collected on each debt, interest or
security.

Sec. 2553. The inventory must also contain an account of all monies
belonging to the decedent which have come to the hands of the executor or
administrator; and if none, the fact must be so stated in the inventory. If the
whole estate consists of money, there need not be an appraisement, but an
inventory must be made and returned as in other cases.

Sec. 2554. The naming of a person as executor does not thereby discharge
him from any just claim which the testator has against him, but the claim must
be included in the inventory, and the executor is liable for the same, as for
such money in his hands, when the debt or demand becomes due.

Sec. 2555. The discharge or bequest in a will, of any debt or demand of the
testator against the executor named, or any other person, is not valid against
the creditors of the decedent, but is a specific bequest of the debt or demand.
It must be included in the.inventory, and if necessary, applied in the payment
of the debts. If not necessary for that purpose, it must be paid in the same
manner and proportion as other specific legacies.

Sec. 2556. The inventory must be signed by the appraisers, and the executor or administrator must take and subscribe an oath before an officer authorized to administer oaths, that the inventory contains a true statement of all the
estate of the decedent which has come to his knowledge and possession, and
particularly of all money belonging to the decedent, and of all just claims of
the decedent against the afiiant. The oath must be indorsed upon or annexed
to the inventory.

Sec. 2557. If an executor or administrator neglects or refuses to return the
inventory within the time prescribed, or within such further time, not exceeding two months, which the court or judge shall for reasonable cause allow, the
court or judge may, upon notice, revoke the letters testamentary or of administration, and the executor or administrator is liable on his bond for any injury
to the estate, or any person interested therein, arising from such failure.

Sec. 2558. Whenever property not mentioned in an inventory that is made
and filed, comes to the possession or knowledge of an executor or administrator, he must cause the same to be appraised in the manner prescribed in this
Article, and an inventory thereof to be returned within two months after the
discovery; and the making of such inventory may be enforced, after notice,
by attachment or removal from office.

Sec. 2559. The executor or administrator is entitled to the possession of
all the real or personal estate of the decedent, and to receive the rents and
profits of the real estate until the estate is settled, or until delivered over by
order of the court or judge to the heirs or devisees; and must keep in good
tenantable repair all houses, buildings and fixtures thereon which are under
his control. The heirs or devisees may themselves, or jointly with the executor or administrator, maintain an action for the possession of the real estate, or
for the purpose of quieting title to or for partition of the same, against any
one except the executor or administrator; but this Section shall not be so
construed as requiring them so to do.

Sec. 2560. Unless it satisfactorily appear to the court or judge that the
rents, issues and profits of the real estate for a longer period are necessary to
be received by the executor or administrator, wherewith to pay the debts of
the decedent, or that it will probably be necessary to sell the real estate for
the payment of such debts, the court or judge, at the end of the time limited
for the presentation of claims against the estate, must direct the executor or
administrator to deliver possession of all the real estate to the heirs at law or

the devisees.

effects of a decedent, he is charged therewith and liable to an action by the
executor or administrator of the estate for double the value of the property so
embezzled or alienated, to be recovered for the benefit of the estate.

Sec. 2571. If any executor or administrator, or any person interested in the
estate of a decedent, complains to the court or judge, on oath, that any person
is suspected to have concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away, or disposed of any monies, goods, or chattels of the decedent, or has in his possession or knowledge any deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts, or other writings
which contain evidences of or tend to disclose the right, title, interest or claim
of the decedent to any real or personal estate, or any claim or demand, or any
lost will, the said court or judge may cite such person to appear before such
court, and may examine him on oath upon the matter of such complaint. If
such person is not in the county where such decedent dies, or where letters
have been granted, he may be cited and examined either before the District
Court or judge of the county where he is found, or before the District Court
or judge of the county where the decedent dies, or where letters have been
granted. But if he appears and is found innocent,his necessary expenses must
be allowed him out of the estate. '

Sec. 2572. If the person so cited refuses to appear and submit to an examination, or to answer such interrogatories as may be put to him, touching the matters of the complaint, the court or judge may, by warrant for that purpose, commit him to the county jail, there to remain in close custody until he submits to
the order of the court, or is discharged according to law. If, upon examination, it
appears that he has concealed, embezzled, smuggled, conveyed away, or disposed of any monies, goods, or chattels of the decedent, or that he has in his
possession or knowledge any deeds, conveyances, bonds, contracts, or other
writings containing evidence of or tending to disclose the right, title, interest or
claim, of the decedent to any real or personal estate, claim, or demand, or any
lost will of the decedent, the court or judge may make an order requiring such

person to disclose his knowledge thereof to the executor or administrator, and
may commit him to the county jail, there to remain until the order iscomplied with, or he is discharged according to law; and all such interrogatories
and answers must be in writing, signed by the party examined, and filed in the
court. The order for such disclosure made upon such examination shall be
primafacie evidence of the right of the executor or administrator to such property in any action brought for the recovery thereof ; and any judgment recovered therein must be for double the value of the property as assessed by the
court or jury, or for the return of the property and damages in addition thereto, equal to the value of such property. In addition to the examination of
the party, witnesses may be produced and examined on either side.

Sec. 2573. The court or judge upon the complaint on oath of any executor
or administrator, may cite any person who has been intrusted with any part of
the estate of the decedent to appear before such court or judge, and require
him to render a full account, on oath, of any monies, goods, chattels, bonds,
accounts, or other property or papers belonging to the estate, which have come
to his possession in trust for the executor or administrator, and of his proceedings thereon ; and if the person so cited refuses to appear and render such account, the court or judge may proceed against him as provided in the preceding Section.

preceding Sections. If there be subsisting liens or encumbrances on the homestead, the claims secured thereby must be presented and allowed as other
claims against the estate. If the funds of the estate be adequate to pay all
claims against the estate, the claims so secured must be paid out of such
funds. If the funds of the estate be not sufficient for that purpose, the claims
so secured shall be paid proportionately with other claims allowed, and the liens
or encumbrances on the homestead shall only be enforced against the homestead
for any deficiency remaining after such payment.

in determining a confirmation or rejection of the majority report, but the
minority report must in no case be confirmed.

must set a day for hearing any objections thereto, from anyone interested in
the estate. Notice of hearing must be given for such time, and in such manner as the court or judge may direct. If the court or judge be satisfied that
the report is correct it must be confirmed, otherwise rejected. In case the
report is rejected, the court or judge may appoint new appraisers to examine
and report upon the homestead, and similar proceedings may be had for the
confirmation or rejection of their report as upon the first report.

Sec. 2595. The costs of all proceedings provided for in this Chapter, must
be paid by the estate as expenses of administration. Persons succeeding by
purchase or otherwise to the interests, rights, and title of successors to homesteads, or to the right to have homesteads set apart to them, as in this Chapter
provided, have all the rights and benefits conferred by law on the persons whose
interests and rights they acquire.

in the notice; such notice must be published as often as the court or judge

been given, and directing that such order be entered in the minutes and recorded, must be made by the court or judge.

Sec. 2603. All claims arising upon contracts, whether the same be due, not

heretofore or hereafter executed, but every such mortgage may be foreclosed within the time and in the manner prescribed by the provisions of this
Code, other than those of this Title, except that no balance of the debt secured
by such mortgage remaining unpaid after foreclosure, shall be a claim against
the estate, unless such debt was presented as required by the provisions of
this Title.

(Sec. 2603. Act approved March 7th, 1895.)

Sec. 2604. Every claim which is due, when presented to the executor or
administrator, must be supported by the affidavit of the claimant, or some one
in his behalf, that the amount is justly due, that no payments have been made
thereon which are not credited, and that there are no offsets to the same, to
the knowledge of the afhant. If the claim be not due when presented, or be
contingent, the particulars of such claim must be stated. When the affidavit

or reject it, and the judge presenting such claim, in case of its rejection by the
executor or administrator, or by such judge as shall have acted upon it, has
the same right to sue in a proper court for its recovery as other persons have
when their claims against an estate are rejected.

Sec. 2606. When a claim, accompanied by the affidavit required in this Chapter, is presented to the’ executor or administrator, he must indorse thereon his
allowance or rejection, with the day and date thereof. If he allow the claim, it
must be presented to the judge for his approval, who must in the same manner indorse upon it his allowance or rejection. If the executor or administrator, or the judge refuse or neglect to indorse such allowance or rejection for
ten days after the claim has been presented to him, such refusal or neglect
may, at the option of the claimant, be deemed equivalent to a rejection on the
tenth day; and if the presentation be made by a notary, the certificate of such
notary, under seal, shall be prima facie evidence of such presentation, and the
date thereof. If the claim be presented to the executor or administrator
before the expiration of the time limited for the presentation of claims, the
same is presented in time, though acted upon by the executor or administrator,
and by the judge, after the expiration of such time.

Sec. 2607. Every claim allowed by the executor or administrator, and approved by the judge, or a copy thereof, as hereinafter provided, must, within

claim be founded on a bond, bill, note, or other instrument, a copy of such instrument must accompany the claim, and the original instrument must be exhibited, if demanded, unless it be lost or destroyed, in which case the claimant
must accompany his claim by his affidavit, containing a copy or particular description of such instrument, and stating its loss or destruction. If the claim.
or any part thereof, be secured by a mortgage, or other lien which has been
recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the land affected by it lies, it shall be sufficient to describe the mortgage or lien, and refer

to the date, volume and page of its record. If, in any case, the claimant has
left an original voucher in the hands of the executor or administrator, or suffered the same to be filed in court, he may withdraw the same when a copy
thereof has been already, or is then, attached to his claim. A brief description
of every claim filed must be entered by the clerk in the register, showing the
name of the claimant, the amount and character of the claim, rate of interest,
and date of allowance.

Sec. 2608. When a claim is rejected either by the executor or administrator,
or the judge, the holder must bring suit in the proper court against the executor or administrator within three months after the date of its rejection, if it be
then due, or within two months after it becomes due, otherwise the claim shall
be forever barred. ‘

Sec. 2609. No claim must be allowed by the executor or administrator, or
by the judge, which is barred by the Statute of Limitations. When a claim is
presented to a judge for his allowance he may, in his discretion, examine the
claimant and others on oath and hear any legal evidence touching the validity
of the claim.

Sec. 2610. No holder of any claim against an estate shall maintain any action thereon, unless the claim is first presented to the executor or administrator,
except in the following case: An action may be brought by any holder of a
mortgage or lien to enforce the same against the property of the estate subject
thereto, where all recourse against other property of the estate is expressly
waived in the complaint; but no counsel fees shall be recovered in such action
unless such claim be so presented.

Sec. 2611. The time during which there shall be a vacancy in the administration must not be included in any limitations herein prescribed.

Sec. 2612. If an action is pending against the decedent at the time of his
death, the plaintifff must in like manner present his claim to the executor or
administrator for allowance or rejection, authenticated as required in other
cases, and no recovery shall be had in the action unless proof be made of the
presentations required.

Sec. 2613. Whenever any claim is presented to an executor or administrator or to a judge, and he is willing to allow the same in part, he must state in
his indorsement the amount he is willing to allow. If the creditor refuse to
accept the amount allowed in satisfaction of his claim, he shall recover no
costs in any action therefore brought against the executor or administrator,
unless he recover a greater amount than that offered to be allowed.

Sec. 2614. A judgment rendered against an executor or administrator, upon
any claim for money against the estate of his testator or intestate, only establishes the claim in the same manner as if it had been allowed by the executor
or administrator and a judge; and the judgment must be that the executor or
administrator pay, in due course of administration, the amount ascertained to be
due. A certified transcript of the original docket of the judgment must be
filed among the papers of the estate in court. No execution must issue upon
such judgment, nor shall it create any lien upon the property of the estate, or
give to the judgment creditor any priority of payment.

Sec. 2615. When any judgment has been rendered for or against the testator or intestate, in his lifetime, no execution shall issue thereon after his
death, except as provided in Section 1216. A judgment against the decedent
for the recovery of money must be presented to the executor or administrator
like any other claim. If execution is actually levied upon any property of the
decedent before his death, the same may be sold for the satisfaction thereof ;
and the officer making the sale must account to the executor or administrator
for any surplus in his hands. A judgment creditor having a judgment which
was rendered against the testator or intestate in his lifetime, may redeem any
real estate of the decedent from any sale under foreclosure or execution in
like manner and with like effect as if the judgment debtor were still living.

Sec. 2616. A judgment rendered against a decedent, dying after verdict or
decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment is rendered thereon, is not a
lien on the real property of the decedent, but is payable in due course of administration.

Sec. 2617. If the executor or administrator doubts the correctness of any
claim presented to him, hemay enter into an agreement in writing, with the
claimant, to refer the matter in controversy to some disinterested person, to
be approved by the court or judge. Upon filing the agreement and approval
of the court or judge, in the office of the clerk of the court for the county in
which the letters testamentary or of administration were granted, the clerk
must enter a minute of the order referring the matter in controversy to the
person so selected; or if the parties consent, a reference may be had in the
court; and the report of the referee, if confirmed, establishes or rejects the
claim the same as if it had been allowed or rejected by the executor or administrator and judge.

Sec. 2618. The referee must hear and determine the matter, and make his
report thereon to the court in which his appointment is entered. The same
proceedings shall be had in all respects, and the referee shall have the same
powers, be entitled to the same compensation, and subject to the same control
as in other cases of reference. The court or judge may remove the referee,
appoint another in his place, set aside or confirm his report, and adjudge costs,
as in actions against executors or administrators, and the order or judgment
thereon shall be as valid and effectual, in all respects, as if the same had been
rendered in an action commenced by ordinary process.

Sec. 2619. When a judgment is recovered with costs, against any executor
or administrator, he shall be individually liable for such costs, but they must
be allowed him in his administration accounts, unless it appears that the suit
or proceeding in which the costs were taxed was prosecuted or defended
without just cause.

Sec. 2620. If the executor or administrator is a creditor of the decedent,
his claim duly authenticated by affidavit must be presented for allowance or
rejection to the judge, and its allowance by the judge is sufficient evidence of
its correctness, and must be paid as other claims in due course of administration. If, however, the judge reject the claim, action thereon may be had
against the estateby the claimant, and summons must be served upon the
judge, who may appoint an attorney, at the expense of the estate, to defend
the action. If the claimant recover no judgment, he must pay all costs,
including defendant's reasonable attorney's fees, to be fixed by the court or
judge. _

Sec. 2621. If an executor or administrator neglects, for two months after
his appointment, to give notice to creditors, as prescribed by this Chapter,
the court or judge must revoke his letters and appoint some other person in
his stead, equally or the next in order entitled to the appointment.

Sec. 2622. At the same time at which he is required to return his inventory,
the executor or administrator must also return a statement of all claims
against the estate which have been presented to him, if so required by the
court or judge, and from time to time thereafter he must present a statement
of claims subsequently presented to him, if so required by the court or judge.
In all such statements he must designate the names of the creditors, the
nature of each claim when it became due, or will become due, and whether it
was allowed or rejected by him.

Sec. 2623. If there be any debt of the decedent bearing interest, whether
presented or not, the executor or administrator may, by order of the court or
judge, pay the amount then accumulated and unpaid, or any part thereof, at
any time when there are sufficient funds properly applicable thereto, whether
said claim he then due or not ; and interest shall thereupon cease to accrue
upon the amount so paid.

same, may borrow money at the lowest rate of interest at which it may be had,
and for such length of time as the court or judge may allow, to pay such claims,
when it shall be made to appear to the court or judge, by petition and evidence,
that an immediate sale of the property of the estate will be detrimental to the
heirs, devisees, legatees, or other persons having an interest therein; and in
such case the estate shall be chargeable with the payment of the sum so borrowed and interest thereon. Such petition may be by the executor or administrator, or by any one of the heirs of the deceased, or other person interested

one sale had, except in the case of perishable property, which may be sold as

provided in Section 2650. The court or judge, when a petition for the sale of

estate for that purpose, upon the order of the court or judge; and an application for the sale of real property may also embrace the sale of personal
property.

See. 2671. To obtain such order for the sale of real property, he must present a verified petition to the court or judge, setting forth the amount of personal property that has come to his hands, and how much thereof, if 'any, remains undisposed of ; the debts outstanding against the decedent, as far as can

the names of the legatees and devisees, if any, and of the heirs of the deceased,
so far as known to the petitioner. If any of the matters here enumerated cannot be ascertained, it must be so stated in the petition; but a failure to set
forth the facts showing the sale to be necessary will not invalidate the subsequent proceedings, if the defect be supplied by the proofs at the hearing, and
the general facts showing such necessity be stated in the order.

Sec. 2672. If it appears to the court or judge, from such petition, that it is
necessary to sell the whole or some portion of the real estate for the purposes
and reasons mentioned in the preceding Section, or any of them, such petition
must be filed and an order thereupon made, directing all persons interested in
the estate to appear before the court or judge, at a time and place specified :
not less than four nor more than ten weeks from the time of making such order,

to show cause why an order should not be granted to the executor or administrator to sell so much of the real estate of the decedent as is necessary.

Sec. 2673. A copy of the order to show cause must be personally served
on all persons interested in the estate, any general guardian of a minor so
interested, and any legatee or devisee, or heir of the decedent, provided they
are residents of the county, at least ten days before the time appointed for

in the county as the court or judge shall direct. If all persons interested in

thereto, the notice may be dispensed with, and the hearing may be had at any
time.

Sec. 2674. The court or judge, at the time appointed in such order, or at
such other time to which the hearing may be postponed, upon satisfactory

oath by either party, and process to compel them to attend and testify may be

by a sale thereof the residue of the estate, real or personal, or some specific
part thereof, would be‘ greatly injured, or diminished in value, or subjected
to expense, or rendered unprofitable, or that after any such sale the residue
would be so small in quantity or value, or would be of such character, with
reference to its future disposition among the heirs or devisees, as clearly to
render it for the best interest of all concerned that the same should be sold,
the court or judge-niay authorize the sale of the whole estate, or of any part
thereof necessary and for the best interest of all concerned.

Sec. 2677. If the court or judge is satisfied, after a full hearing upon the
petition and an examination of the proofs and allegations of the parties interested, that a sale of the whole or some portion of the real estate is necessary,
for any of the causes mentioned in this Article, or if such sale be assented to
by all the persons interested, an order must be made to sell the whole, or so
much and such parts of the real estate described in the petition, as the court
or judge shall judge necessary or beneficial.

Sec. 2678. The order of the sale must describe the lands to be sold and
the terms of sale, which may be for cash, or on a credit not exceeding oneyear
payable in gross or in installments, with interest, as the court or judge may
direct. The land may be sold in one parcel or in subdivisions, as the executor
or administrator shall judge most beneficial to the estate, unless the court or
judge otherwise specially directs. If it appears that any part of such real estate has been devised, and not charged in such devise with the payment of
debts or legacies, the court or judge must order the remainder to be sold before that so devised. Every such sale must be ordered to be made at public
auction, unless, in the opinion of the court or judge, it would benefit the estate
to sell the whole or some part of such real estate, at private sale. The court
or judge may, if the same is asked for in the petition, order or direct such real
estate or any part thereof, to be sold at either public or private sale, as the executor or administrator shall deem to be most beneficial for the estate. If the
executor or administrator neglects or refuses to make a sale under the order,
and as directed therein, he may be compelled to sell, by order of the court or
judge, made on motion, after due notice, by any party interested.

Sec. 2679. If the executor or administrator neglects to apply for an order
of sale when it is necessary, any person may make application therefore, in the
same manner as the executor or administrator, and notice thereof must be given to the executor or administrator, before the hearing. The petition of such
applicant must contain as many of the matters set forth in Section 2671 as he
can ascertain, and the order of sale must fix the period of time within which
the executor or administrator must make the sale.

Sec. 2680. When a sale is ordered, and is to be made at public auction, notice
of the time and place must be posted in three of the most public places in the
county in which the land is situated, and published in a newspaper, if there be
one printed in the same county, but if none, then in such paper as the court or
judge may direct, for three weeks successively next before the sale; the lands
and tenements to be sold must be described with common certainty in the
notice. , ‘

Sec. 2681. Sales at public auction must be made in the county where the
land is situated, but when the land is situated in two or more counties, it may
be sold in either. The sale must be made between the hours of nine o'clock in
the morning and the setting of the sun on the same day, and must be made on
the day named in the notice of sale, unless the same is postponed.

Sec. 2682. When a sale of real estate is ordered to be made at private sale,
notice of the same must be posted up in three of the most public places in the
county in which the land is situated, and published in a newspaper, if there be
one printed in the same county; if none, then in such paper as the court or
judge may direct, for two weeks successively next before the day on or after
which the sale is to be made, in which the lands and tenements to be sold must
be described with common certainty. The notice must state a day on or after
which the sale will be made, and a place where offers or bids will be received.
The day last referred to must be at least fifteen days from the first publication
of notice, and the sale must not be made before that day, but must be made
within six months thereafter. The bids or offers must be in writing, and may
be left at the place designated in the notice, or delivered to the executor or
administrator personally, or may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court
to which the return of sale must be made, at any time after the first publication of the notice and before the making of the sale. If it be shown that it
will be for the best interest of the estate, the court or judge may, by an order,
shorten the time of notice, which shall not, however, be less than one week,
and may provide that the sale may be made on or after a day less than fifteen,
but not less than eight days from the first publication of the notice, in which
case the notice of sale, and the sale, may be made to correspond with such
order.

Sec. 2683. No sale of real estate at private sale shall be confirmed by the
court or judge, unless the sum offered is at least ninety per cent. of the appraised value thereof, nor unless such real estate has been appraised within one
year of the time of such sale. If it has not been so appraised, or if the court
or judge is satisfied that the appraisement is too high or too low, appraisers
must be appointed, and they must make an appraisement thereof in the same
manner as in case of an original appraisement of an estate. This may be done
at any time before the sale or the confirmation thereof.

Sec. 2684. The executor or administrator must, when the sale is made upon
a credit, take the notes of the purchaser for the purchase money, with a mortgage on the property to secure the payment.

Sec. 2685. The executor or administrator after making any sale of real
estate, must make a return of his proceedings to the court, which must be filed
in the office of the clerk, at any time subsequent to the sale. A hearing upon
the return of the proceedings may be asked for in the return or by petition
subsequently, and thereupon the court or judge must fix the day for the hearing, of which notice thereof of at least ten days must be given by the clerk,

by notices posted in three public places in the county, or by publication in a
newspaper, or both, as the court or judge shall direct, and must briefly indicate
the land sold, the sum for which it was sold, and must refer to the return for
further particulars. Upon the hearing the court or judge must examine the
return and witnesses in relation to the same, and if the proceedings were unfair,
or the sum bid disproportionate to the value, and if it appear that a sum exceeding such bid at least ten per cent., exclusive of the expenses of a new sale,
may be obtained, the court or judge may vacate the sale and direct another to
be had, of which notice must be given, and the sale in all respects conducted
as if no previous sale had taken place. If an offer of ten per cent. more in
amount than that named in the return be made to the court in writing, by a
responsible person, it is in the discretion of the court or judge to accept such
offer and confirm the sale to such person, or to order a new sale.

Sec. 2686. When return of the sale is made and filed, any person interested
in the estate may file written objections to the confirmation thereof, and may
be heard thereon, when the return is made by the court or judge, and may produce witnesses in support of his objections.

Sec. 2687. If it appears to the court or judge that the sale was legally made
and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid was not disproportionate to the value
of the property sold, and that a greater sum, as above specified, cannot be
obtained, or if the increased bid mentioned in Section 2685 be made and
accepted by the court or judge, the court or judge must make an order confirming the sale and directing conveyances to be executed. The sale from that
time is confirmed and valid, and a certified copy of the order confirming it and
directing conveyances to be executed, must be recorded in the office of the
county clerk of the county in which the land sold is situated. If after the
confirmation, the purchaser neglects or refuses to comply with the terms of
sale, the court or judge may, on motion of the executor or administrator, and
after notice to the purchaser, order a resale to be made of the property. If
the amount realized on such resale does not cover the bid and the expenses of
the previous sale, such purchaser is liable for the deficiency to the estate.

Sec. 2688. Conveyances must thereupon be executed to the purchaser by the
executor or administrator, and they must refer to the orders of the court
authorizing and confirming the sale of the property of the estate, and directing
conveyances thereof to be executed, and to the record of the order of confirmation in the office of the county clerk, either by the date of such recording,
or by the date, volume, and page of the record, and such reference shall have the
same effect as if the orders were at large inserted in the conveyance. Conveyances so made convey all the right, title, interest, and estate of the decedent in

mortgage or lien, and the residue, if any, in due course of administration. The
application of the purchase money to the satisfaction of the mortgage or lien
(must be made without delay; and the land is subject to such mortgage or
lieng until the purchase money has been actually so applied.

0 claim against any estate, which has been presented and allowed, is
affected by the Statute of Limitations, pending the proceedings for the settlement of the estate. The purchase money, or so much thereof as may be
sufiicient to pay such mortgage or lien, with interest, and any lawful costs and
charges thereon, may be paid into the court, to be received by the clerk thereof, whereupon the mortgage or lien upon the land must cease, and the purchase
money must be paid over by the clerk of the court without delay, in payment
of the expenses of the sale, and in satisfaction of the debt to secure which the
mortgage or other lien was taken, and the surplus, if any, at once returned to
the executor or administrator, unless for good cause shown, after notice to the

is insufiicient to defray the expenses and discharge his mortgage or lien, he
must pay to the court, or the clerk thereof, an amount sufiicient to pay such
expenses.

Sec. 2782. Any person interested in any estate may, at any time before the

Sec. 2783. If the court or judge is satisfied, either from the oath of the applicant or from any other testimony offered, that the facts alleged are true. and

day to be named in the citation, and render an exhibit as prayed for.

Sec. 2784. When an exhibit is rendered by an executor or administrator,any

citation has been first issued, served and returned, requiring the executor or
administrator to appear and show cause why an attachment should not issue.
Every account must exhibit all debts which have been presented and allowed
during the period embraced in the account.

Sec. 2787. When the authority of an executor or administrator ceases, or
is revoked for any reason, he may be cited to account before the court or
judge, at the instance of the person succeeding to the administration of the
same estate, in like manner as he might have been cited by any person
interested in the estate during the time he was executor or administrator.

Sec. 2788. If the executor or administrator resides out of the county, or

is lost, or for other good reasons cannot be produced on the settlement, the
payment may be proved by the oath of any competent witness.

Sec. 2790. On the settlement of his account he may be allowed any item of
expenditure not exceeding twenty_ dollars, for which no voucher is produced,
if such item be supported by his own uncontradicted oath positive to the fact
of payment, specifying when, where, and to whom it was made ; but such allowances in the whole must not exceed five hundred dollars against any one
estate, and if, upon such settlement of accounts it appear that debts against
the deceased have been paid without the affidavit and allowance prescribed by
statute or Sections 2604, 2605 and 2606, of this Code, and it shall be proven by
competent evidence to the satisfaction of the court or judge that such debts
were justly due, were paid in good faith, that the amount paid was the true
amount of such indebtedness over and above all payments or set off, and that
the estate is solvent, it shall be the duty of the said court or judge to allow
the said sums so paid in the settlement of said accounts. Sec. 2791. When any account is rendered for settlement the court or judge
may appoint a day-for the settlement thereof ; the clerk must thereupon give
notice thereof by causing notices to be posted in at least three public places in
the county, setting forth the name of the estate, the executor or administrator,
and the day appointed for the settlement of the account. The court or judge
may order such further notice to be given as may be proper.

Sec. 2792. If the account mentioned in the preceding Section be for final
settlement, and a petition for the final distribution of the estate be filed with
said accounts, the notice of the settlement must state those facts, which notice

must be given by posting or publication, as the court or judge may direct, and
for such time as may be ordered. On the settlement of said account, distribution and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto may be immediately had,
without further notice of proceedings.

Sec. 2793. On the day appointed, or any subsequent day to which the hearing may be postponed by the court or judge, any person interested in the estate
may appear and file his exceptions in writing to the account, and contest the
same.

the accounts, and make report thereon, subject to confirmation ;and may allow
a reasonable compensation to the referees, to be paid out of the estate of the
decedent.

Sec. 2 795. The settlement of the account and the allowance thereof by the court
or judge, or upon appeal, is conclusive against all persons in any way interested
in the estate, saving, however, to all persons laboring under any legal disability,
their right to move for cause to reopen and examine the account, or to proceed

-by action against the executor or administrator, either individually or upon his

bond, at any time before final distribution ; and in any action brought by any
such person, the allowance and settlement of the account is prima facie evidence of its correctness.

Sec. 2796. The account must not be allowed by the court or judge until it
is first proved that notice has been given as required by this Chapter, and the
order must show that such proof was made to the satisfaction of the court or
judge, and is conclusive evidence of the fact.

Sec. 2797. Whenever it appears to the court or judge on any hearing of an
application for the sale of real property, that it would be for the interest of the
estate that personal property of the estate, or some part of such property,
should be first sold, the court or judge may order the sale of such personal
property, or any part of it, and the sale thereof shall be conducted in the same
manner as if the application had been made for the sale of such personal property in the first instance.

Sec. 2798. Pending the settlement of any estate, on the petition of the executor, administrator or any one or more of the heirs, legatees or devisees, the
court or judge may order any monies in the hands of any executor or administrator to be loaned, for such length of time as may be requested by the party
petitioning and the court or judge may think to the interests of the estate;
and on such security as the court or judge thereof may approve of, which shall
not be a period of time to exceed one year at any one time; but no money
shall be loaned, exce t on United States, State, county or approved municipal
bonds or real estate ortgage (and then only to the extent of one-half of the
market value of the real estate so loaned upon the value of said property, to
be estimated by the judge). The term “real estate" as herein used, does not

manner prescribed by the court or judge.

S 3. Debts having preference by the laws of the United States, or of the
tate.

4. Judgments rendered against the decedent in his lifetime, and mortgages
in the order of their date.

5. All other demands against the estate. .

Sec. 2811. The preference given in the preceding Section to a mortgage
only extends to the proceeds of the property mortgaged. If the proceeds of
such property is insufficient to pay the mortgage, the part remaining unsatisfied must be classed with the other demands against the estate.

Sec. 2812. If the estate is insufiicient to pay all the debts of any one class,
each creditor must be paid a dividend in proportion to his claim, and no
creditor of any one class shall receive any payment until all those of the preceding class are fully paid.

Sec. 2813. The executor or administrator, as soon as he has sufficient funds
in his hands, may pay the funeral expenses and expenses of the last sickness,
and the allowance made to the family of the decedent. He may retain in his
hands the necessary expenses of administration, but he is not obliged to pay
any other debt or any legacy until, as prescribed in this Article, the payment
has been ordered by the court or judge.

Sec. 2814. Upon the settlement of the accounts of the executor or administrator, as required in this Chapter, the court or judge must make an order for
the payment of the debts, as circumstances of the estate require. If there is
not sufficient funds in the hands of the executor or administrator, the court or
judge must specify in the order the sum to be paid to each creditor. If the
whole property of the estate be exhausted by such payment or distribution,
such account must be considered as a final account and the executor or administrator is entitled to his discharge on producing and filing the necessary
vouchers and proofs, showing that such payments have been made, and that he
has fully complied with the order of the court or judge.

Sec. 2815. If there is any claim not due, or any contingent or disputed
claim against the estate, the amount thereof, or such part of the same as the
holder would be entitled to if the claim were due,‘ established, or absolute,
must be paid into the court, and there remain to be paid over to the party
when he becomes entitled thereto ; or, if he fails to establish his claim, to be
paid over or distributed as the circumstances of the estate require. If any
creditor whose claim has been allowed, but is not yet due, appears and assents
to a deduction therefrom of the legal interest for the time the. claim has yet to
run, he is entitled to be paid accordingly. The payments provided for in this
Section are not to be made when the estate is insolvent, unless a pro rata distribution is ordered.

Sec. 2816. When an order is made by the court or judge, for the payment
of creditors, the executor or administrator is personally liable to each creditor
for his allowed claim, or the dividend thereon, and execution may be issued on
such decree, as upon a judgment in the court, in favor of each creditor, and the
same proceedings may be had under such execution as under execution in
other cases. The executor or administrator is liable therefore on his bond to
each creditor.

Sec. 2817. When the accounts of the administrator or executor have been
settled, and an order made for the payment of debts and distribution of the

estate, no creditor, whose claim was not included in the order for payrtnhent‘,e1ii;s

Sec. 2834. When any bond has been executed and delivered under the

Sec. 2860. When the estate, real or personal, assigned by the order of distribution to two or more heirs, devisees or legatees, is in common and undivided, and the respective shares are not separated and distinguished, partition
or distribution may be made by three disinterested persons, to be appointed
commissioners for that purpose by the court or judge, who must be duly sworn
to the faithful dischar e of their duties. A certified copy of the order of their

‘appointment, and of t e order assigning and distributing the estate, must be
issued to them as their warrant, and their oath must be indorsed thereon.
Upon consent of the parties, or when the court or judge deems it proper and
just, it is sufficient to appoint one commissioner only, who has the same
authority and is governed by the same rules as if three were appointed.

Sec. 2861. Such partition may be ordered and had in the District Court on
the petition of any person interested. But before commissioners are appointed,
or partition ordered by the court or judge, as directed in this Chapter, notice
thereof must be given to all persons interested who reside in this State, or to
their guardians, and to the ents, attorneys, or guardians, if any in this State,
of such as reside out of this tate, either rsonally or by public notice, as the
court may direct. The petition may be filzd, attorneys, guardians and agents
appointed, and notice given at any time before the order of distribution, but
the commissioners must not be appointed until the order is made distributing
the estate.

Sec. 2862. If the real estate is in different counties, the court or judge may,
if deemed proper, appoint commissioners for all, or different commissioners for
each county. The estate in each county must be divided separately among
the heirs, legatees, or devisees. as if there was no other estate to be divided;
but the commissioners first appointed must, unless otherwise directed by the
court or judge, make division‘ of such real estate wherever situated within this
State.

Sec. 2863. Partition or distribution of the real estate may be made as provided in this Chapter, although some of the original heirs, legatees or devisees
may have conveyed their shares to other persons, and such shares must be assigned to the person holding the same, in the same manner as they otherwise
would have been to such heirs, legatees or devisees.

Sec. 2864. When both distribution and partition are made, the several
shares in the real and personal estate must be set out to each individual in proportion to his right, by metes and bounds, or description, so that the same can
be easily distinguished, unless two or more of the parties interested consent to

'have their shares set out so as to be held by them in common and undivided.

Sec. 2865. When the real estate cannot be divided without prejudice or
inconvenience to the owners, the court or judge may assign the whole to one
or more of the parties entitled to share therein, who will accept it, always preferring the males to the females, and among children preferring the elder to the
younger. The parties accepting the whole must pay to the other parties interested their just proportion of the true value thereof, or secure the same to
their satisfaction, or in case of the minority of such party, then to the satisfaction of his guardian; and the true value of the estate must be ascertained and
reported by the commissioners. When the commissioners appointed to make
partition are of the opinion that the real estate cannot be divided without
prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, they must so report to the court or
judge, and recommend that the whole be assigned as herein provided, and must
find and report the true value of such real estate. On filing the report of the
commissioners, and on making or securing the payment as before provided, the
court or judge, if it appears just and proper, must confirm the report, and thereupon the assignment is complete, and the title to the whole of such real
estate vests in the person to whom the same is assigned.

Sec. 2866. When any tract of land or tenement is of greater value than any
one’s share in the estate to be divided, and cannot be divided without injury to
the same, it may be set off by the commissioners appointed to make partition
to any of the parties who will accept it, giving preference as prescribed in the
preceding Section. The party accepting must pay or secure to the others
such sums as the commissioners shall award to make the partition equal, and
the commissioners must make their award accordingly; but such partition must
not be established by the court or judge until the sums awarded are paid to
the parties entitled to the same, or secured to their satisfaction.

Sec. 2867. When it appears to the court ‘or judge, from the commissioner's
report that it cannot otherwise be fairly divided and should be sold, the court
or judge may order the sale of the whole or any part of the estate, real or personal, by the executor or administrator, or by a commissioner appointed for
that purpose, and the proceeds distributed. The sale must be conducted, reported and confirmed, in the same manner and under the same requirements
provided in Article IV., Chapter VII, of this Title.

Sec. 2868. Before any partion is made or any estate divided, as provided in
this Chapter, notice must be given to all persons‘ interested in the partition,
their guardians, agents, or attorneys, by the commissioners, of the time and
place when and where they shall proceed to make partition. The commissioners
may take testimony, order surveys, and take such other steps as may be necessary to enable them to form a judgment upon the matters before them.

See. 2869. The commissioners must report their proceedings, and the partition agreed upon by them, to the court or judge, in writing, and the court or
judge may, for sufiicient reasons, set aside the report, and commit the same to
the same commissioners, or appoint others; and when such report is finally
confirmed, a certified copy of the order of partition made thereon, attested by
the clerk under the seal of the court, must be recorded in the office of the
county clerk of the county where the lands lie.

Sec. 2870. When the court or judge makes an order assigning the residue of any
estate to one or more persons entitled to the same, it is not necessary to appoint
commissioners to make partition or distribution thereof, unless the parties to
whom the assignment is made, or some of them, request that such partition be
made.

Sec. 2871. All questions as to advancements made, or alleged to have been
made, by the decedent to his heirs, may be heard and determined by the court
or judge, and must be specified in the order assigning and distributing the
estate ; and the final order of the court or judge, or in case of appeal, of the
Supreme Court, is binding on all parties interested in the estate.

interested therein, the court or judge may, by order, direct a sale to be made of

proper, and the purchase money to be deposited in the State treasury.

Sec. 2884. The agent is liable on his bond for the care and preservation of the
estate while in his hands, and for the payment of the proceeds of the sale as
required in the preceding Sections, and may be sued thereon by any person

Sec. 2885. When any person appears and claims the money paid into the
treasury, the court or judge making the distribution must inquire into such
claim. and being first satisfied of his right thereto, must grant him a certificate
to that effect, under seal; and upon the presentation of the certificate to him,
the State Auditor must draw his warrant on the treasurer for the amount.

Sec. 2886. When the estate has been fully administered, and it is shown by
the executor or administrator, by the production of satisfactory vouchers, that

Sec. 3100. Judicial evidence is the means sanctioned by law, of ascertaining
in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a uestion of fact.

Sec. 3101. Proof is the effect of evidence, t e establishment of a fact by
evidence.

Sec. 3102. The law of evidence, which is the subject of this part of the
Code, is a collection of general rules established by law:

1. For declaring what is to be taken as true without proof.

2. For declaring the presumptions of law, both those which are disputable
and those which are conclusive.

3. For the production of legal evidence.

4. For the exclusion of whatever is not legal.

. For determining in certain cases the value and effect of evidende.

Sec. '3103. The law does not require demonstration ; that is, such a degree of
proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty, because
such proof is rarely possible. Moral certainty is only required or that degree of
proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.

Sec. 3104. There are four kinds of evidence:

1. The knowledge of the court.

2. The testimony of witnesses.

3. Writings.

4. Other material objects presented to the senses.

Sec. 3105. There are several degrees of evidence:

1. Primary and secondary.

2. Direct and indirect.

3. Prima facie, partial, satisfactory, indispensable and conclusive.

Sec. 3106. Primary evidence is that kind of evidence which, under every
pqmssible circumstance, affords the greatest certainty of the fact in question.

us, a written instrument is itself the best possible evidence of its existence
and contents.

Sec. 3107. Secondary evidence is that which is inferior to primary. Thus,
a copy of an instrument, or oral evidence of its contents, is secondary evidence
of the instrument and contents.

Sec. 3108. Direct evidence is that which proves the fact in dispute directly without an inference or presumption, and which in itself, if true, conclusively establishes that fact. For example, if the fact in dispute be an agreement,
the evidence of a witness who was present and witnessed the making of it, is
direct. Sec. 3109. Indirect evidence is that which tends to establish the fact in
dispute by proving another, and which, though true, does not of itself conclusively establish that fact, but which affords an inference or presumption of its existence. For example, a witness proves an admission of the party to the fact in
dispute. This roves a fact, from which the fact in dispute is inferred.

Sec. 3110. rima facie evidence is that which sufhces for the proof of a
particular fact, until contradicted and overcome by other evidence. For
example, the certificate of a recording officer is prima facie evidence of a
record, but it may afterward be rejected upon proof that there is no such
record.

Sec. 3111. Partial evidence is that which goes to establish a detached fact,
in series tending to the fact in dispute. It may be received, subject to be rejected as incompetent, unless connected with the fact in dispute by proof of
other facts. For example, on an issue of title to real property, evidence of
the continued possession of a remote occupant is partial, for it is of a detached

fact, which ma or may not afterward be connected with the fact in dis ute.

Sec. 3112. e evidence is deemed satisfactory which ordinarily pr uces
moral certainty or conviction in an ungrejudiced mind. Such evidence alone
will justify a verdict. Evidence less t an this is denominated slight evidence.

Sec. 3113. Indispensable evidence is that without which a particular fact
cannot be proved.

Sec. 3114. Conclusive or unanswerable evidence is that which the law does
not permit to be contradicted. For example, the record of a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be contradicted by the parties to it.

Sec. 3115. Cumulative evidence is additional evidence of the same character to the same point.

Sec. 3116. Corroborative evidence is additional evidence of a different character to the same point.

3145. A rnsative only can be proved.

3146. acts wkick may be proved on trial.

Sec. 3120. The direct evidence of one witness who is entitled to full credit
is sufficient for proof of any fact, except perjury and treason.

Sec. 3121. A witness can testify to those facts only which he knows of his
own knowledge: that is, which are derived from his own perceptions, except
in those few express cases in which his opinions or inferences, or the declarations of others are admissible.

Sec. 3122. A witness can be heard only upon oath or affirmation and upon
a trial he can be heard only in the presence and subject to the examination of
all the parties, if they choose to attend and examine.

Sec. 3123. A witness is presumed to speak the truth. This presumption,
however, may be repelled by the manner in which he testifies, by the character
of his testimony, or by evidence affecting his character for truth, honesty or
integrity, or his motives, or by contradictory evidence, and the jury are the
exclusive judges of his credibility.

Sec. 3124. The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by the declaration,
act or omission of another, except by virtue of a particular relation between
them; thereforee proceedings against one cannot affect another.

Sec. 3125. Where, however, one derives title to real property from another,

the declaration, act or omission of the latter, while holding the title in relation
to the property is evidence against the former.

Sec. 3126. Where, also, the declaration, act or omission forms part of a
transaction, which is itself the fact in dispute, or evidence of that fact, such
declaration, act, or omission is evidence, as part of the transaction.

Sec. 3127. And where the question in dispute between the parties is the
obligation or duty of a third person, whatever would be the evidence for or
against such person is prima facie evidence between the parties.

Sec. 3128. The declaration, act, or omission of a member of a family, who
is a decedent, or out of jurisdiction, is also admissible as evidence of common
reputation, in cases where, on questions of pedigree, such reputation is admissible.

Sec. 3129. The declaration, act, or omission of a decedent, having sufiicient
knowledge of the subject, against his pecuniary interest, is also admissible as
evidence to that extent against his successor in interest.

See. 3130. When part of an act. declaration, conversation or writing is given
in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into
by the other ; when a letter is read, the answer may be given ; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence, any other
act, declaration, conversation or writing, which is necessary to make it understood, may also be given in evidence.

Sec. 3131. There can be no evidence of the contents of a writing, other than
the writing itself, except in the following cases:

1. Where the original has been lost or destroyed ; in which case the proof
of the loss or destruction must first be made.

2. When the original is in the possession of the party against whom the
evidence is offered, and he fails to produce it after reasonable notice.

3. When the original is a record or other document in the custody of a
public officer.

4. When the original has been recorded, and a certified copy of the record
is made evidence by this Code or other statute.

5. When the original consists of numerous accounts or other documents,
which cannot be examined in court without great loss of time, and the evidence
sou ht from them is only the general result of the whole.

11 the cases mentioned in Subdivisions 3 and 4, a copy of the original or of
the record must be produced; in those mentioned in Subdivisions 1 and 2,
either a copy or oral evidence of the contents.

Sec. 3132. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing
by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms, and thereforee there can be between the parties and their representatives, or successors
in interest, no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than the contents
of the writing, except in the following cases:

1. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the
pleadings.

2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute. But this
Section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the
agreement was made, or to which it relates, as defined in Section 3136, or to
explain an extrinsic ambiguity, or to establish illegality or fraud. The term
agreement includes deeds and wills, as well as contracts between parties.

Sec. 3133. The language of a writing is to be interpreted according to the
meanin it bears in the place of its execution, unless the parties have reference
to a di erent place.

Sec. 3134. In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office of the
judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to’ omit what has been
inserted ; and where there are several provisions or particulars, such aconstruction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give efiect to all.

Sec. 3135. In the construction of a statute the intention of the Legislature,
and in the construction of the instrument, the intention of the parties is to be
pursued if possible ; and when a general and icular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former. a particular intent will control
a general one that is inconsistent with it.

Sec. 3136. For the proper construction of an instrument, the circumstances
under which it was made, including the situation of the subject of the instrument and of the parties to it, may also be shown, so that the judge be placed
in the position of those whose language he is to interpret.

Sec. 3137. The terms of a writing are presumed to have been used in their
primary and general acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless admissible that
they have a local technical, or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so used
and understood in the particular instance, in which case the agreement must be
construed accordingly. ,

Sec. 3138. When an instrument consists partly of written words and rtly
of a printed form, and the two are inconsistent, the former controls the atter.

Sec. 3139. When the characters in which an instrument is written are diflicult to be deciphered, or the language of the instrument is not understood by
the court, the evidence of persons skilled in deciphering the characters, or who
understand the language, is admissible to declare the characters or the meaning
of the language.

Sec. 3140. When the terms of an agreement have been intended in a different sense by different parties to it, that sense is to prevail against either party
in which he supposed the other understood it, and when different constructions
of a provision are otherwise equally proper, that is to be taken which is most
favorable to the party in whose favor the provision was made.

Sec. 3141. A written notice, as well as every other writing, is to be construed according to the ordinary acceptation of its terms. Thus, a notice to the
drawers or indorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory note, that it has been
protested for want of acceptance or payment, must be held to import that the
same has been duly presented for acceptance or payment, and the same refused,
and that the holder looks for payment to the person to whom the notice is

ven.
g‘ Sec. 3142. When a statute or instrument is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of natural right and the other against it, the former
is to be adopted.

Sec. 3143. None but a material allegation need be proved.

Sec. 3144. Evidence must correspond with the substance of the material
allegations, and be relevant to the question in dispute. Collateral questions
must thereforee be avoided. It is, however, within the discretion of the court
to permit inquiry into a collateral fact, when such fact is directly connected
with the uestion in dispute, and is essential to its proper determination, or
when it a%ects the credibility of a witness.

Sec. 3145. Each party must prove his own aliirmative allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation, except when such
negative allegation is an essential part of the statement of the right or title on
which the case of action is founded, nor even in such case when the allegation
is a denial of the existence of a document, the custody of which belongs to the
opposite party.

Sec. 3146. In conformity with the preceding provisions, evidence may be
given upon a trial of the following facts:

1. The precise fact in dispute.

2. The act, declaration, or omission of a party, as evidence against such
party.

3. An act or declaration of another, in the presence and within the observation of a party, and his conduct in relation thereto.

4. The act or declaration, verbal or written, of a deceased person in respect

to the relationship, birth, marriage, or death of any person related by blood
or marriage to such deceased person; the act or declaration of a deceased
person done or made against his interest in respect to his real property; and
also in criminal actions, the act or declaration of a dying person, made under
a sense of impendin ~ death, respecting the cause of his death.

5. After proof o a partnership or agency, the act or declaration of a partner or agent of the party, within the scope of the partnership or agency, and
during its existence. The same rule applies to the act or dec aration of a joint
owner, joint debtor, or other person jointly interested with the party.

6. After proof of a conspiracy, the act or declaration of a conspirator against
his co-conspirator, and relating to the conspiracy.

7. The act, declaration or omission forming part of a transaction, as explained in Section 3126.

8. The testimony of a witness deceased, -or out of the jurisdiction, or unable to testify, given in a former action between the same parties, relating to
the same matter. '

9. The opinion of a witness respecting the identity or handwriting of a person, when he has knowledge of the person or handwriting; his opinion of a
question of science, art or trade, when he is skilled therein.

10. The opinion of a subscribing witness to a writing; the validity of which
is in dispute, respecting the mental sanity of the signer; and the opinion of intimate acquaintanceship respecting the mental sanity of a person, the reason
for the opinion being given.

II. Common reputation existing previous to the controversy, respecting
facts of a public or general interest more than thirty vears old, and in cases of
pedigree and boundary.

12. Usage, to explain the true character of an act, contract or instrument,
where such true character is not otherwise plain; but usage is never admissible,
except as an instrument of interpretation. '

I3. Monuments and inscriptions in public places, as evidence of common
reputation; and entries in family bibles, or other family books or charts,
engravings on rings, family portraits and the like, as evidence of pedigree.

14. The contents of a writing, when oral evidence thereof is admissible.

15. Any other facts from which the facts in issue are presumed or are logically inferable.

16. Such facts as serve to show the credibility of a witness as explained in
Section 3123.

Sec. 3197. Other judicial orders of a court or judge of this State, or of the
United States, create a disputable presumption, according to the matter directly determined, between the same parties and their representatives and successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or
special proceeding, litigating for the same thing under the same title and in the
same capacity.

Sec. 3198. The parties are deemed to be the same when those between
whom the evidence is offered were on opposite sides in the former case, and a
judgment or other determination could in that case have been made between
them alone, though other parties were joined with both or either.

Sec. 3199. That only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment
which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually
and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto.

Sec. 3200. Whenever pursuant to the last four Sections, a party is bound

by a record, and such party stands in the relation of a surety for another, the

Sec. 3201. The effect of a judicial record of a sister State is the same in
this State as in the State where it was made, except that it can only be

not extend beyond the jurisdiction of the Government under which he was
invested with his authority.

Sec. 3202. The effect of the judicial record of a court of admiralty of a
foreign country is the same as if it were the record of a court of admiralty of
the United States.

Sec. 3203. The effect of the judgment of any other tribunal of a foreign
count having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment is as follows:

I. n case of a judgment against a specific thing, the judgment is conclusive upon the title to the thing.

2. In case of a judgment against a person, the judgment is presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties and their successors in interest by a
subsequent title, and can only be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud or clear mistake of law or
fact. ,

Sec. 3204. Any judicial record ma be impeached by evidence of a want of
jurisdiction in the court or judicial o cer, of collusion between the parties, or
of fraud in the party offering the record, in respect to the proceedings.

Sec. 3205. The jurisdiction sufficient to sustain arecord is jurisdiction over
the cause, over the parties, and over the thing, when a specific thing is the subject of the judgment.

Sec. 3220. Private writings are either:

1. Sealed ; or,

2. Unsealed.

Sec. 3221. A seal is a particular sign, made to attest in the most formal
manner, the execution of an instrument.

Sec. 3222. A public seal in this State is a stamp or impression made by a
public officer with an instrument provided by law to attest the execution
of an official or public document, upon the paper, or upon any substance
attached to the paper, which is capable of receiving a visible impression. A
private seal may be made in the same manner by any instrument, or it may be
made by the scroll of a pen, or by writing the word “ seal " against the signature of the writer. A scroll or other sign, made in a sister State or foreign
country, and there recognized as a seal, must be so regarded in this State.

Sec. 3223. There shall be no diHerence hereafter in this State between
sealed and unsealed writings. A writing under seal may thereforee be changed,
or altogether discharged by a writing not under seal.

Sec. 3224. The execution of an instrument is the subscribing and delivering
it, with or without affixing a seal. _

Sec. 3225. An agreement in writing, without a seal, for the compromise or
settlement of a debt, is as obligatory as if a seal were affixed.

Sec. 3226. A subscribing witness is one who sees a writing executed or hears
it acknowledged, and at the request of the party thereupon signs his name as
a witness.

Sec. 3227. Historical works, books of science or art, and published mapsor charts, when made by persons indiHerent between the parties, are prima
facit evidence of facts of general notoriety and interest.

Sec. 3228. The original writing must be produced and proved, except as
provided in this Part. If it has been lost, proof of the loss must first be made
before evidence can be given of its contents. Upon such proof being made,
together with proof of the due execution of the writing, its contents may be
proved by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document,
or by the recollection of a witness, as hereinbefore provided.

Sec. 3229. If the writing be in the custody of the adverse party, he must
first have reasonable notice to produce it. If he then fail to do so, the contents of the writing may be proved as in case of its loss. But the notice to
produce it is not necessary where the writing is itself a notice, or where it has
been wrongfully obtained or withheld by the adverse party. Sec. 3230. Though a writing called for by one party is produced by the
other, and it is thereupon inspected by the party calling for it, he is not obliged
to produce it as evidence in the case.

Sec. 3231. Any writing may be proved either:

I. By anyone who saw the writing executed ; or,

2. By evidences of the genuineness of the handwriting of the maker; or,

3. By a subscribing witness.

Sec. 3232. If the subscribing witness denies or does not recollect the execution of the writing, its execution may still be proved by other evidence.

Sec. 3233. Where, however, evidence is given that the party against whom
the writing is offered has at any time admitted its execution, no other evidence

of the execution need be given, when the instrument is one mentioned in Section 3236, or one produced from the custody of the adverse party, and has been
acted upon by him as genuine.

Sec. 3234. The handwriting of a person may be proved by anyone who
believes it to be his, and who has seen him write, or has seen writings purporting to be his, upon which he has acted or been charged, andwho has thus
acquired a knowledge of his handwriting.

Sec. 3235. Evidence respecting the handwriting may also be given by comparison, made by the witness or jury, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine
to the satisfaction of the judge.

Sec. 3236. Where a writing is more than thirty years old, the comparisons
may be made with writing proporting to be genuine, and generally
respected and acted upon as such, by persons having an interest in knowing
the fact.

Sec. 3237. The entries and other writings of a decedent, made at or near
the time of the transaction, and in a position to know the facts stated therein,
may be read as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, in the following cases:

1. When the entry was made against the interest of the person making it.

2. When it was made in a professional capacity, and in the ordinary course
of professional conduct.

3. When it was made in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by
law.

Sec. 3238. When an entry is repeated in the regular course of business,
one being copied from another or at or near the time of the transaction, all the
entries are equally regarded as originals.

Sec. 3239. Every private writing, except last wills and testaments, may be
acknowledged or proved and certified in the manner provided for the acknowledgment of proof of conveyances of real property, and the certificate of such
acknowledgment or proof is prima facie evidence of the execution of the
writing in the same manneras if it were a conveyance of real property.

Sec. 3240. The record of a conveyance of real property, or any other
record, a transcript of which is admissible in evidence, must not be removed
from the office where it is kept, except upon the order of a court or judge, in
cases where the inspection of the record is shown to be essential to the just
determination of the cause or proceeding pending, or where the court is held
in the same building with such office.

Sec. 3241. Every instrument conveying or affecting real property, acknowledged or proved and certified, as rovided in the Civil Code, and every instrument authorized by law to be Filed or recorded in the county clerk's office,
may, together with the certificate of acknowledgment or proof, be read in evidence in an action or proceeding, without further proof ; also, the original
record of such conveyance or instrument thus acknowledged or proved or a
certified copy of the record of such conveyance or instrument thus acknowledged or proved, may be read in evidence, with the like eHect as the original
instrument, without further proof.

CHAPTER IV.

MATERIAL OBJECTS PRESENTED TO THE SENSES, OTHER THAN WRITINGS.

Sm-lion 3250. Alain-:'aI objeru.

Sec. 3250. Whenever an object, cognizable by the senses, has such a relation to the fact in dispute as to afford reasonable grounds of belief respecting
it, or to make an item in the sum of the evidence, such object may be exhibited to the jury, or its existence, situation, or character may be proved by witnesses. The admission of such evidence must be regulated by the sound discretion of the court. CHAPTER V.

by writing. _

Sec. 3275. The preceding Section must not be construed to affect the power
of a testator in the disposition of his real property by a last will and testament,

the time of the sale, of the kind of property sold, the terms of the sale, the
price, and the names of the purchaser and person on whose account the sale is

Sec. 3300. The process by which the attendance of a witness is required is
by a subpoena. It is a writ on order directed to a person and requiring his
attendance at a particular time and place to testify as a witness. It may also
require him to bring with him any books, documents or other things under his
control, which he is bound by law to produce in evidence.

Sec. 3 301. The subpoena is issued as follows:

1. To require attendance before a court, or at a trial of an issue therein, it
is issued under the seal of the court before which the attendance is required,
or in which the issue is pending.

2. To require attendance out of the court, before a judge, justice or other
officer authorized to administer oaths or take testimony in any matter under
the laws of this State, it is issued by the judge, justice, or any other officer
before whom the attendance is required.

3. To require attendance before a commissioner appointed to take testimony
by a court of a foreign country, or of the United States, or of any other State
in the United States, or of any other district or county within this State, or before any officer or officers empowered by the laws of the United States to take
testimony, it may be issued by any judge, justice of the peace in places within
their respective jurisdiction; with like power to enforce attendance, and, upon
certificate of contumacy to said court, to punish contempt of their process, as
such judge or justice could exercise if the subpoena directed the attendance of
the witness before their courts in a matter pending therein.

Sec. 3302. The service of a subpoena is made by showing the original and
delivering a copy, or a ticket containing its substance, to the witness personally,
giving or offering to him at the same time, if demanded by him, the fees to
which he is entitled for travel to and from the place designated, and one day's
attendance there. The service must be made so as to allow the witness a reasonable time for preparation and travel to the place of attendance. Such service
may be made by any person. '

Sec. 3303. If a witness is concealed in a building or vessel, so as to prevent
the service of a subpoena upon him, any court or judge, or any officer issuing

court room any witness of the adverse party, not at the time under examination, so that he may not hear the testimony of other witnesses.

Sec. 3372. The court must exercise a reasonable control over the mode of
interrogation, so as to make it as rapid, as distinct, as little annoying to the
witness, and as eHective for the extraction of the truth as may be; but, subject
to this rule, the parties may put such pertinent and legal questions as they see
fit. The court, however, may stop the production of further evidence upon a
particular point when the evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude
reasonable doubt.

Sec. 3373. The examination of a witness by the party producing him is denominated the direct examination, the examination of the same witness, upon

interest of justice require it.

Sec. 3375. A witness is allowed to refresh his memory respecting a fact by
anything written by himself or under his direction at the time when the fact
occurred or immediately thereafter, or at any other time when the fact was
fresh in his memory and he knew that the same was correctly stated in the
writing. But in such case the writing must be produced and may be seen by
the adverse party, who may, if he choose, cross-examine the witness upon it,
and may read it to the jury. So, also. a witness may testify from such a writing, though he retain no recollection of the particular facts, but such evidence
must be received with caution.

Sec. 3376. The opposite party may cross-examine the witness as to any
facts stated in his direct examination or connected therewith, and in so doing
may put leading questions, but if he examine him as to other matters, such
examination is to be subject to the same rules as a direct examination.

Sec. 3377. The party producing a witness is not allowed to impeach his
credit by evidence of bad character, but he may contradict him by other evidence, and may also show that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony, as provided in Section 3380.

Sec. 3378. A witness once examined cannot be re-examined as to the same
matter without leave of the court, but he may be re-examined as to any new
matter upon which he has been examined by the adverse party. And after
the examinations on both sides are once concluded, the witness cannot be
recalled without leave of the court. Leave is granted or withheld, in the
exercise of a sound discretion.

Sec. 3379. A witness may be impeached by the party against whom he was
called, by contradictory evidence, or by evidence that his general reputation
for truth, honesty, or integrity is bad, but not by evidence 0 particular wrongful acts, except that it may be shown by the examination of the witness, or
the record of the judgment, that he has been convicted of a felony.

Sec. 3380. A witness may also be impeached by evidence that he has made
at other times, statements inconsistent with his present testimony; but before
this can be done the statements must be related to him, with the circumstances
of times, places, and persons present, and he must be asked whether he
made such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them. If the statements
be in writing, they must be shown to the witness before any question is put
to him concerning them.

Sec. 3 38!. Evidence of the good character of a party is not admissible in a
civil action, nor of a witness in any action until the character of such party or
witness has been impeached, or unless the issue involves his character.

by the opposite party, and if proved by the witness must be read to the jury
before his testimony is closed, or it cannot be read except on recalling the witness.

Section 3390. 7 ury judges of eject of evidence, but to be instructed on certain points.

See. 3390. The jury subject to the control of the court, in the cases specified in this Code, are the judges of the effect or value of evidence addressed to
them, except when it is declared to be conclusive. They are, however, to be
instructed by the court on all proper occasions:

I. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence is not arbitrary,
but to be exercised with legal discretion, and in subordination to the rules of
evidence.

2. They are not bound to decide in conformity with the declarations of
any number of witnesses, which do not produce conviction in their minds.

against a less number or against a presumption or other evidence satisfying
their minds.

others.

4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with distrust,
and the evidence of the oral admissions of a party with caution.

5. That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue must be proved, and when
the evidence is contradictory the decision must be made according to the reponderance of the evidence; that in criminal cases guilt must be establis ed
beyond reasonable doubt.

6. That evidence is to be estimated not only by its own intrinsic weight,
but also according to the evidence which it is in the power of one side to produce, and of the other to contradict; and, thereforee,

7. That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered, when it appears
that stronger and more satisfactory was within the power of the party, the
evidence oliered would be viewed with distrust.
