verification shall not make other 01� greater proof necessary
on the side of the adverse party. The verification of any
pleading of a corporation may be by any officer or agent on
whom the summons in an action against the corporation may
be served, or by its attorney in the action. 
\ � 143. The verification by affidavit mentioned in the last 
section, shall not be required to the answer of a guardian or
committ.ee defending for an infant, or person of unsound 
mind 01� imprisoned; nor in any case where the admission of
the truth of the allegations of the petition or answer might
subject the party to a criminal or penal prosecution; nor to
pleadings affecting injuries to person or character; nor to 
petitions in actions founded on a note, bond, bill of exchange, 
mortgage, or other written obligation of the defendant; nor
to defenses founded on the written obligation, release, or

on which the action or defense is founded is lost, mutilated,
or destroyed. 
� 144. Neitaer presumptions of law, nor matters of which
judicial notice is taken, need be stated in a pleading. 
� 145. If the action, counterclaim, or set-off, is founded
on a note, bond, bill, or other writing, as evidence of iudebt�
~dness, it must be filed as a part of the pleading, if in the
power of the party to produce it. If not filed, the reason 
thereof must be stated in the pleading. If upon an account,
a copy thereof must, in like manner, be filed with the plead�
mg. 
� � 14G. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally
construed, with a view to substantial justice between the
parties. 
� 14 7. If irrelevant or redundant matter is inserted in a
pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person
aggrieved thereby, at the cost of the party whose pleading

� 148. In pleading a judgment, or other determination,
of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be
necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, hut such 
judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly
given or ma<l~. If such allegation is made in a petition, and 
is not controverted in the answer, or made in the answer in 
relation to a counterclaim or set-off, and is not controverted
in the reply, it need not be proved on the trial. 
� 14g_ In pleading the performance of a condition prece�
dent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts

necessary to state in the petition any extrinsic facts, for the
purpose of showing the application to the plaintifff of the

but it shall be sufficient to state, generally, that the same 
was published or spoken concerning the plaintifff; and if such
allegation is not controverted as stated in section 148 in
regard to judgments, it shall not be necessary to prove it on 
the trial. 
� 151. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the 
defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the
matter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circum� 
stances legally admissible in evidence, to reduce the amount
of damages; and whether he proves the justification or not,
he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances. 
� 152. In an action for the recovery of real property, it
must be described in the petition with such convenient cer�
tainty, as to enable an officer holding an execution to identi� 
fy it. 
� � 153. Every material allegation of the petition not spe�
cifically controverted by the answer, and every material alle�
gation of new matter in the answer, constituting a counter�
claim or set-off, not specifically controverted by the reply,
must, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. But.
the allegation of new matter in the answer, not relating to 
a counterclaim or set-off, or of new matter in a reply, is to 
be deemed controverted by the adverse party as upon a
direct denial or avoidance, us the case may require. Allega�
tions of value, or of amount of damage, shall not be con�
sidered as true, by the failure to controvert them. 
� 154. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essen�
tial to the claim or defense, and which could not be stricken 
from the pleading without leaving it insufficient. 
� �155. If either party shall rely upon any deed, or other
writing, he shall file with his pleading the original deed or
writing, if in his power. If he cannot produce such deed
or writing, he shall so state in his pleading, together with
the reasons therefore; and if such reasons are sufficient, he
may file the best evidence of the contents of such deed or 
writing in his power. Original deeds, and other writings,
filed by either party as above provided, shall remain on file
for the inspection of the other party, until allowed by the

� 166. Court may permit amendments without verification. 
� 156. No variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it has actually
misled the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his
action or defense upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged
that n. party has been so misled, that fact must be shown to 
the satisfaction of the court, and it must also be shown in
what respect he bas been misled; and, thereupon, the court
may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as
may be just. 
� 157. Where the variance is not material as provided in
the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found 
according to the evidence, and may order an immediate
amendment without costs. 
� 158. Where, however, the allegation of the claim or
defense to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in
some particular or particulars only, but in its general scope
and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of variance within
the last two sections, but a failure of proof. 
� 159. The plaintifff may amend his petition without leave, 
at any time before an answer is filed, and without prejudice
to the proceedings already had. 
� IGO. Upon a demurrer being overruled, the party de�
murring may answer or reply. 
� 161. The court may, at any time, in furtherance of jus�
tice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any plead�
ing or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of
any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a par�
ty, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other
allegations material to the case, or, when the amendment 
does not change substantially the claim or defense, by con� 
forming the pleading or p~ceeding ~ the facts proved. 
~�ll (-,,\ \ 
The oourt may likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer or 
reply to be made, after the time limited by this Code, or, by 
an order, enlarge such time. And whenever any proceeed� 
ing taken by a party fails to conform in any respect to the
provisions of this Code, the court may permit an amendment
of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto.
And when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or
uncertain that the precise nature of the claim or defense is 
not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made
definite and certain by amendment, The court must, in 
every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in the
proceedings which does not affect the substantial rights of
the adverse party"; and no Judgment shall be reversed or af� 
fected by reason of such error or defect. �
� 162. The plaintifff and defendant, respectively, may 
be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint,
answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occur� 
ring after the filing of the former petition, answer, or reply.
� 163. �when either party shall amend any pleading or 
proceeding, and the court shall be satisfied, by affidavit or
otherwise, that the adverse party could not be ready for
trial in consequence thereof a continuance may be grant� 
ed to some day in the same term, or to another term of the
court. 
� 164. Where petitions are filed without verification, as
required by section 142, the action shall not, on that account,
be dismissed, if the verification be made on or before the
calling of the action for trial. � 
� 1G5. No objection shall be taken, after judgment, to 
any pleading for the want of, or defect. in the verification. 
� 166. Courts may permit the amendments authorized by 
this chapter to be made without being verified, as prescribed
in section 142, unless a new and distinct cause of action or
defense is thereby introduced.

insane person, or in respect to which he is trustee. Any
such submission, so made in good faith, and tfie award
made thereupon shall be binding, and entered as the 
judgment or decree of the court. No such fiduciary
shall be responsible for any loss sustained by an award 
adverse to the interest he, represents, unless the same
be caused by his fault or neglect. 
5. If any arbitrator shall fail or refuse to act, the
court may set aside the order of reference. 
6. The arbitrators and umpire, if there be one, shall
meet at such convenient times and places as may be
necessary, ( of which the parties shall have reasonable 
notice.) and hear such evidence as either party may 
adduce. They shall have power to administer oaths.
They shall make their award in writing, stating therein 
the time when it is made, and sign the same. When
the award is made out, one copy thereof shall be deliv�
ered to each of the contending parties, and the original
returned to the court, on which the arbitrators shall note
the time of delivering a copy to each party. 
7. If such award be made out and returned, and
copies delivered ten days before the term of the court
next succeeding such delivery, the same shall be en�
tered of record and made the judgment or decree of 
the court, unless on exceptions filed the award shall be 
set aside. 
8. No award shall be set aside for the want of form. 
But courts shall have power over awards on equitable
principles as heretofore. 
9. Matters within the jurisdiction of a justice of the
peace may be submitted to arbitrators, by an order, 
rule, or agreement entered on his record book in the
same manner, and the proceedings under it shall be the 
same in every respect, as are authorized and required in
other courts. Either party may appeal to the circuit
court from the judgment of the justice on the award, 
as in other cases.

tion in equity shall be filed wherever a bill in chancery is 
directed therein, which sections are as follows : 
1. Wills shall be proved before, and admitted to re�
cord by, the county court of the county of the testa� 
tor's residence; if he had no known place of residence
in this state, and land is devised, then in the county
where the land, or the greater part thereof lies; if no
land is devised. then in the county where he died or 
~' �~'tha~~\hi~la~, or the greater part thereof, shall
\. lie, or where there may be any debt or demand owing 
to him. � 
2. A writ of error, or an appeal, shall lie from the

3. No will shall be received in evidence, until it has
been allowed and admitted to record by a county
court; and its probate before such court shall be con� 
clusive, until the same is superseded, reversed, or an�

has in his custody the will of a testator, may summon
him and, by proper process, compel him to produce the 
same. 
5. When a will of a non-resident of this state relative 
to estate within this state has been proved without the
same, an authenticated copy thereof and the certificate
of probate' thereof may be offered. for probate in this
state. When such copy is so offered, the court to which 
it is offered shall presume, in the absence of evideaoe 
to the contrary, that the will was duly executed and ad� 
mitted to probate as a will of personalty in the state or
country of the testator's domicil, and shall admit such
copy to probate as a will of personalty in this state. 
And if it appears from such copy that the will was prov�
ed in the foreign court of probate to have been so exe�
cuted as to be a valid will of lands in this state by the
law thereof, such copy may be admitted to probate as a 
will of real estate. 
6. When any will or any such authenticated copy is
offered for probate, and a witness attesting the same re�
sides out of this state, or though in the state is in con�
finement in another county or corporation under legal
process, or is unable from sickness, age, or other infirmi� 
ty, to attend the court before which the same is of�
fered, or resides at a distance of more than fifty miles,
such court may cause a commission to be issued, an� 
nexed to the said will or copy, and directed to any
person authorized by law to take depositions in other 
cases, to take his deposition. The deposition of such
witness shall be taken and certified as depositions are 
taken in other cases; except that no notice need be 
given of the time and place of taking the same, un�
less it is in a case in which the probate is opposed by
some person who has made himself a party. And 
the proof so given shall have the same effect as if it 
had been given in the court from which the commis�
sion issued. 
7. A person offering or intending to oiler to a coun� 
ty court a will for probate, may obtain from the clerk
of such court process directed to the proper officer of!
any county, requiring him to su~mon any person inter- 
. " . 
ested in such probate to appear at the next term of such
court, and show cause why the said will should not be 
admitted to record. 
8. The court to which a will is offered for probate,
may cause all persons interested in the probate to be
summoned to appear on a certain day. 
9. Any person interested in such probate may be 
summoned, or proceeded against by order of appear�
ance; and to any person so interested who is an infant
or of unsound mind, a guardian ad lit em may be assign�
ed as in other cases. 
10. When the proceeding is taken to the circuit
court, all necessary parties shall be brought before the 
court; and upon the demand of any one of them, a
jury shall be impanneled to try which or how much of
any testamentary paper produced is, or is not, the last
will of the testator. If no jury be demanded, the
court shall determine that question, and the final decis�
ion given shall be a bar to any other proceeding to call
the probate or rejection of the will in question-sub�
ject to the right of appeal or writ of error to the court
of appeals as hereinbefore named; but nothing in this
section shall preclude a court of chancery from its 
jurisdiction to impeach such final decision, for such rea�
son as would give it jurisdiction over any other judg� 
ment at law.
11. A county court may, however, without summon� 
ing any party, proceed to probate and admit the will to
record or reject the same. 
12. Any person interested, who, at the time of the
final decision in the circuit court, resided out of this
state, and was proceeded against by order of appearance
only without actual appearance or being personally serv- 
~~,u, rrocess,~id a~y ~her pei:,-,g_n intereited who 
,�ft~D~~~~y t \lte~~ceeaing~~tuilP4>~\irance
or being ~rsonal y served with process, may, within 
three years after such final decision in the circuit court, 
by bill in chancery impeach the decision and have a re� 
trial of the question of probate; and either party shall
be entitled to a jury for the trial thereof. An infant,
not a party, shall not be barred of such proceeding in
chancery until twelve months after attaining full age. 
13. But no such proceeding in chancery for establish�
ing or avoiding a will, shall operate further than is ne�
cessary to the rights of such infant, non-resident, or oth�
er party, or otherwise affect the rights of any other per� 
son interested in the probate.
14. The record of what is proved or deposed in court 
by witnesses on the motion to admit a will to record,
and any depositions lawfully taken out of court on such
motion, of witnesses who cannot be produced at a trial 
afterwards before a jury, may, on such trial, be admit� 
ted as evidence, to have such weight as the jury shall
think they deserve. 
15. Every will or authenticated copy so admitted to
record by any court shall be recorded by the clerk
thereof and remain in his office, except during such
time as the same may be carried to another court under 
a subpama duces tecum.
16. A will may be deposited by the person making 
it, or any one for bim, with the clerk of tho county
court of the county of his residence, for safe keeping,
upon payment of a fee of one dollar to the clerk, who 
shall receive, keep, and deliver the same according to 
t~e directions on a sealed envelope. If there are no
such directions, or the party entitled does not apply,

to make such settlements is hereby repealed. If, in 
any case, the judge cannot make such settlement with

� 522. The proceedings on caveats shall be according to 
the provisions of chapter 11, of the Revised Statutes, which
are as follows: 
1. If any person obtains a survey of land to which
another claims a better right, such other may enter a 
caveat 'with the register to prevent the issuing. of a
grant until the right is determined. The caveat shall
state the plaintifff's claim, and the reasons why the grant
should not issue. It shall be verified by his affidavit, 
or by that of his agent, and declare that it is entered
in good faith, with the intention of procuring the land
for the plaintifff, and not for the benefit of the person
against whom it is entered. A copy of the caveat, 
certified by the register, shall, within fifteen days from
the time it was entered, be handed to the clerk of the 
circuit court of the county where the land, or the great�
er part thereof, lies, who shall immediately issue a sum�
mons thereon, returnable to the first day of the next 
term of the court, against the defendant, and renew
the same from term to term, if required. If the sum� 
mons be not returned, or be returned not executed, the 
caveat shall be dismissed at the costs of the plaintifff,
unless it appear that the non-return or non-execution
was not occasioned by the neglect of the plaintifff. If
the summons is executed fifteen days before the first day
of the term, and the caveat shall stand for trial at that 
term, and the defendant shall, on or before its call, file his
written response thereto, verified by his affidavit. If
the summons be not so executed, it shall stand for trial 
at the next term after it is so executed. All issues of
fact made by the caveat and the response shall be tried
by a jury, if required by either party. If the defend� 
ant be a non-resident of this state, he may be proceed�
ed against, and with the like effect, as is permitted
against a non-resident in any other suit. Upon service
of the summons, or upon notice to plaintifff of the filing
of defendant's response in the clerk's office during va�
cation, either party, respectively, may proceed to take 
depositions. The court may permit an amendment of
the statement contained in the caveat or response, and
may give time for further preparation. If the copy of

� 657. Court to exercise control over interrogation of witnesses. 
� 658. Direct and cross examination. 
� 659. What is a leading question and by whom it may be asked. 
� 660. Parts cannot impeach but may contradict his own witness. 
� 661. �How a witness may be impeached by the adverse party. 
� 662. Before evidence of a contradictory statement is admissible,
witness must be questioned concerning the statement. 
� 663. Evidence of good character inadmissible before general charactef has been impeached. 
� 664. Re-examination of witness. 
� 665. Witnesses may be examined out of hearing of each other. 
� 666. Persons present though not summoned may be compelled to
testify. 
� 667. Judge or juror may be examined as a. witness. 
� 668. Writings shown to a witness must be shown to the adverse
party. 
� 656. The party who begins the case, must ordinarily
exhaust his evidence before the other begins. But the order
of proof shall be regulated by the court, so as to expedite
the trial, and enable the tribunal to obtain a clear view of
the whole evidence. 
� 657. The court shall exercise a reasonable control over
the mode of interrogation so as to make it rapid, distinct, as
little annoying to the witness, and as effective for the ex�
traction of the truth as may be; but subject to this control, 
the parties may put such legal and pertinent questions as
they may see flt, The court, however, may stop the pro� 
duction of further evidence on a particular point, where the
evidence upon it is already so full as to preclude reasonable 
doubt. 
� 658. The examination of a witness by the party pro�
ducing him, is the direct examination; the examination of
the same witness upon the same matter, by the adverse par�
ty, the cross-examination. The direct examination must be
completed before the cross-examination begins, unless the
court otherwise directs. 
� 659. A question that suggests to the witness the an�
swer which the examining party desires, is a leading ques�
tion. On the direct examination, leading questions are not 
allowed, except under special circumstances making it ap�
pear that the interests of justice require it. On cross-ex� 
amination, the adverse party may put leading questions;
but if he examines the witness on new matters, such ex� 
amination is subject to the same rules as the direct examina�
tion. 
� 660. The party producing a witness is not allowed to 
impeach his credit by evidence of bad character, unless it is
a case in which it was indispensable that the party should 
produce him; but he may contradict him by other evidence,
and by showing that he has made statements different from
his present testimony. 
� 661. A witness may be impeached by the party against
whom he is produced, by contradictory evidence, by showing 
that he has made statements different from his present testi�
mony, or by evidence that his general reputation for truth
or immorality renders him unworthy of belief, but not by
evidence of particular wrongful acts, except that it may be
shown by the examination of a witness, or record of a judg� 
ment, that he has been convicted of felony. 
� 66~. Before other evidence can be offered of the witueaa 
having made at another time a different statement, he must 
be inquired of concerning the same, with the circumstances
of time, place, and persons present, as correctly as the ex�
amining party can present them; and if it is in writing, it
must be shown to the witness, and he allowed to explain it. 
� 663. Evidence of the good character of a witness is
inadmissible until his general reputation has been impeach�
ed. 
� 664. A witness once examined, cannot be re-examined
as to the same matter, without leave of the court. But he
may be re-examined as to any new matter upon which he
has been examined by the adverse party. After the exami�
nation on both sides is concluded, the witness cannot be
recalled without leave of the court. 
� 665. If either party requires it, the judge may exclude
from the court room any witness of the adverse party not at 
the time under examination, so that he may not hear the
testimony of the other witnesses. 
� 666. A person present before a court or a judicial offi�
cer, may be compelled to testify in the same manner as if
he was served with a subpeena. 
� 667. The judge or a juror may be called as a witness
by either party, but in such case, it is in the discretion of
the court to suspend the trial and order it to take place be�
fore another judge or jury; and where a party knows, at 
the time the jury are sworn, that a juror is to be called by
him as a witness, he shall then disclose it, and the juror shall
be excluded from the jury. 
� 668. Whenever a writing is shown to a witness, it may 
be inspected by the adverse party, and, if proved by the
witness, it mus, he read to the jury before his testimony is
closed; otherwise, it cannot be read, unless the witness is 
recalled.
