.actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in main-
taining his action or defense upon the merits. When it shalt

proved to the satisfaction of the court, showing in what re�
spect he has been misled, and thereupon the court may order
the pleading to be amended upon such terms as shall be just. 
SuH-SEc. 79. When the variance between the allegation
and the pleading and the proof is not material, the court may 
direct the facts to be found according to the evidence, or may

days after the service of the answer or demurrer to such
pleading, unless it be made to appear to the court that it was
done for the purpose of delaying, and the plaintifff or defend�
ant will thereby Jose the benefit of a term for which the cause
is or may be placed on the jury trial docket, and if it appears
to the court that such amendment was made for such pur�

his district, or when in attendance upon the supreme court,
and the district counts, except for jury trials, are declared to
be at all ti mes in session for all purposes, including naturaliz-
ation of aliens. Interlocutory orders may be made by such
judge wherevm� h� may be in the territory, upon notice, if
outside of his d ist.rict , in cases where notice is required, for 
such time us the court shall deem proper, in addition to the
time otherwise prescribed. In the absence from the terri-

any other judge may render such judgment, order or decree. 
8UH-8EC. 104. Any hearing of any kind, whether inter-
locutory or final, unless trial hy jury is necessary, may be

SUB-SEC. 10:>. When an action is against two or more de-
fendants jointly or severally liable on a contract, and the 
summons is served on one or more, but not all of them, the

same manner as if thev were the only defendants, but the 
action shall not abate a .... to other dPfondants, and shall pro- 
ceed to final judgment against any or all of such other defend�
ants, and when necessary more than one judgment may be 
rendered in the same action.
SuH-SEc. ]Oft Judgment may be had if the defendant fail 
to answer the complaint as notified by the summons as fol�
lows: 
First. In case of default adjudged against a party for non�
appearance or for failure to plead or amend his pleadings, as
required by law or the rules of the court, when the action is
for a money demand, and the amount of the proper judgment
is a mere matter of com pu tat ion. the clerk shall ascertain the
amount. When long accounts are to be examined, the court
may refer the matter. In other cases the court shall assess
the damages, unless a jury be demanded by the party not in
default. The proper amount having been ascertained by 
either of the above methods, judgment shall be rendered
therefore. 
Second. In other actions, if no answer has been filed with 
the clerk of the court within the time. specified in the sum�
mons or such further time as may have been granted, the
court or judge, upon application of the plaintifff, must enter
the default of the defendant and render judgment. If the
taking of an account or the proof of any fact is necessary to 
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment
into effect, the court may take the account or hear the proof,
or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that purpose.
And where the action is for the recovery of damages, in whole
or in part, the court may order the damages to be assessed 
by a jury in term time, or, if to determine the amount of dam�
ages the examination of a long account be involved, by refer�
ence. as herein provided. 
Third. In actions where the service of the summons is bv
publication, the plaintifff, upon the expiration of the time to"r
answering, may, upon proof of the publication and that no
answer has been filed, apply for judgment, and the court must
thereupon require proof to be made of the demand mentioned
in the complaint, and, if the defendant he not a resident of the
territory, may req uire the plaintifff or his agent to be exam�
ined on oath respecting any payments that have been made
to the plaintifff or to any one for his use on account of such de�
mand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is
�n titled to recover. 
SuH-SEc. 107. Issues arise upon the pleadings when a
fact or conclusion of law is maintained by the one party and
controverted by the other. They arr- of two kinds: 
First. Of law; and
Second. Of fact.
An issue of law arises upon a demu rrer to the complaint. 
answer or reply, or to some part thereof.
An issue of fact arises upon a material allegation in the 
complaint controverted by the answer: or upon new matter in 
the answer controverted by the reply� or upon new matter in
the reply, unless an issue of law is joined thereon. 
Ht:H-SEc. JOH. Issues. both of Jaw and of fact, may u rj se
upon d itfr-rent parts of tho ploarlinsr� in the same action. In 
such cases the issues of law must be first tried, unless the
court otherwise directs.

sues between the parties, whether they be is ... ues of law or of
fact. 
ScB-SEc. 110. An issue of law must be tried by the court,
unless it be referred as provided in sub-sections one hund rorl 
and thirty-eight and one hundred and thirty-nine of this
act. An issue of fact in an action for the recovery of money
only, or specific real or personal property, where the right
of trial by jury existed at common law, must be tried by a
jury, unless a jury trial be waived or a reference be ordered.
But this shall not be construed to limit the power of the court 
to administer all remedies and grant equitable relief which it
could heretofore do under its general chancery jurisdiction. 
SvH-SEc. 111. Every other issue is triable by the court,
which however, may order the whole iss u�, or any specific
question or fact involved therein. to be tried by u jury: or
may refer it as provided in sub-sections one hundred and
thirty-eight and one hundred and thirty-nine of this act.

givin~ the notice shall also furnish the clerk, at least eight
days before the terrn of court, with a notice to put said cause 
upon the jury trial docket for trial. It shall be the duty of
the clerk to put all causr-s, of which he has received notice of
trial, upon the docket in the order of the tiling of the Just
pleading in such cause. 
AJl causes in which damages are to be assessed or other
facts to be determined by a jury, where the issues are not
made up upon the pleadings, may, at the instance of the
eourt or either of the parties, upon notice, be placed upon the
jury trial docket. Whenever the issues in a cause are made
up during a regular term of court, or within twenty days
prior thereto, the court may, upon application of either party,
place such cause on the trial docket in its proper order for
trial. and the same may be tried at that term of the court,
unless it is made to appear that such trial will work a pre�
judice to the opposite party. 
SuB-SEc. llH. Either party ton, suit placed upon the trial
docket may bring- the same to trial, and in the absence of the
adverse party, unless the court, for g-,HKI cause, otherwise di�
rect, may proceed with the case, and take a dismissal of the
complaint or a verdict or judgment, as the ease may require. 
A separate trial between a plaintifff and any of the several de�
fendants may be allowed by the court, whenever in its opinion
justice will thereby be promoted. 
SvB-8Ec. 114. When a, verdict is found for the plaintifff in
an action for the recovery of money, or for the defendant
when a set-off for the recovery of money is established be�
yond the amount of the plaintiffs claim as established, the
jury must also assuss the amount of the recovery: they may
also, under the direction of tlH� court, assess tho amount of
tl1e recovery whr-n the �ou rt gin~s judgment for tho plain t i rf 
on the answer. If a set-off established at the trial exceed th�
plaintifff's demand as established, judgment for the defend�
ant must be given for the excess, 01� if it appear that the de�
fendant is entitled to any other affirmative relief, judgment
must be given accordingly. 
SuH-8.Ec. 11 r). When a tender of money is alleged in any 
pleading, it shall not be necessary to deposit the money in
court, when the pleading is filed. but it shall be sufficient if
the money is deposited in court at the trial, or when ordered
by the court. 
Sus-SEC. l Ht If an original pleading be lost or withheld
by any person, the court may allow a eopy thereof to be sub� 
stituted. 
Sus-SEC. 117. When actions of a like nature or relative to�
the same question are pending, the court or judge may make
such orders and rules concerning proceedings therein as may
he conformable to the usages of the courts for avoiding un�
necessary delay in the administration of justice, and on mo�
tion and notice to the adverse party, require him to show
cause why the same shall not be consolidated, and if no cause
be shown such actions shall be consolidated. 
SUB-SEC. 1 lR. The defendant may, at any time before the
trial or verdict, serve upon the plaintifff an offer in writing to
allow judgment to be jaken against him for the sum or prop�
erty or to the effect therein specified, with costs. If the plaint�
iff accept the offer and give notice thereof in writing within
two days, he may file the offer with notice of acceptance, and 
the clerk must thereupon enter judgment accordingly. If
the notice of acceptance be not given, the offer is to be deemed
withdrawn and cannot be given in evidence, and if the plaint�
iff fail to obtain a more favorable judgment, he cannot recover
costs from the time of the offer. 
SuH-SEc. 1 rn. Whenever a ruling is made upon objections
to the admission or rejection of testimony, or in the� case of
any other ruling or acts during the progress of a trial before
a court or referee, or any ruling or decision at any time dur�
ing the progress of a cause, it shall not be necessary to take 
any exception, but a review thereof may he had as if such ex� 
ception had been taken and noted: and it shall not be neces�
sary to object or except to the giving 01� refusal to give in�
structions to a jury in order to secure a review of the same 
on writ of error or appeal, but such instructions shall be re�
viewed in the same manner as if such instructions had been 
speciticallv excepted to at the time of giving- or refusal to gh�e
the same. 
SUH-SEC. J ~o. The court before which an action is pend� 
ing, or the judge thereof, may, in his discretion and upon due
notice, order either party to give to the other, within a
specified time, an inspection and a copy or permission to take 
a copy of a. paper in his possession or under his control con� 
taining evidence relating to the merits of the action. If com�
pliance with the order be refused, the court, on motion, may
exclude the paper from being given in evidence or punish the
party refusing' as for a contempt, or both.

is so amended, that where the defendant cannot be served
personally with the process, and shall have no place of resi�
dence in this territory, and the property of the defendant
shall have been attached in time to make the necessary pub�
lication as now required by law, the officer executing the said
process, or the agent or attorney of the plaintifff in said case,
is hereby authorized to make publication of notice to the de�
fendant in such attachment in the manner now prescribed by
Jaw, which shall have the same force and effect to compel the
appearanct~ of the defendant in any such suit in attachment,
as if such publication of notice had been in conformity to au
order of court as heretofore required; and upon satisfactory
proof being made to the court of the publication of said notice, 
the plaintifff may proceed in said case as if the process had
been served personally upon the said defendant. 
~ ~703. When the defendant shall be notified, by publica�
tion as aforesaid, and shall not appear and answer the action,
judgment by default may be entered, which may be pro�
ceeded on to final judgment as in ordinary actions, but such
judgment shall only bind the property attached, and shall he
no evidence of indebtedness against the defendant in any 
subsequent suit. _ 
~ ~704. When property of the defendant found in his pos�
session, or in the hands of any other person, shall be attached,
the defendant or such other person may retain possession
thereof by giving bond and security to the satisfaction of the
officer executing the writ, to the officer or his successor in
double the value of the property attached, conditioned that
the same shall be forthcoming when and where the court shall
direct, and shall abide the judgment of the court.

return, with the writ, all bonds taken by him in virtue there�
of, a schedule of a11 property and effects attached, and the
names of all the garnishees, the times and places when and
where respectively summoned. 
~ 2706. If the officer willfully fail to return a good and
sufficient bond in any case where bond is required by this
law, he shall be held and considered as security for the per�
formance of aJI acts and the payment of all money to secure
the performance of which such bond ought to have been
taken. 
~ 2707. In all eases when property or effects shall be at�
tached, the defendant may, at the court to which the writ is
returnable, put in his answer, without oath, denying the
truth of any material fact contained in the affidavit, to which
the plaintifff may reply: a trial of the truth of the affidavit
shall be had at the same term, and on such trial the plaintifff
shall be held to prove the existence of the facts set forth in
the affidavit as the ground of the attachment, and if the issue
shall be found for him the cause shall proceed, but if it be 
found for the defendant the cause shall be dismissed at the
costs of the plaintifff. 
~ 2708. The plaintifff may exhibit in the cause, written al�
legations and interrogatories at the return term of the w rit,
and not afterwards, touching the property, effects and credits
attached in the hands of any garnishee. The garnishee shall
oxhibit and file his answer thereto.on oath,duringsuch term,
unless the court, for good cause shown, shall order otherwise.
In default of such answer, or of a sufficient answer, the plaint�
iff may take judgment by default against him, or the court
may, upon motion, compel him to answer by attachment of his
body. 
~ 270H. Such judgment by default may be proceeded on
to final judgment in like manner, as in cases of the defendant
in actions upon contracts, but no final judgment shall be ren�
dered against the gn rnishee until tlwre shall be final judg�
ment against the defendant. 
� 271 O. The plaintifff may deny the answer of the gar�
nishee in whole or in part, and the issue shall be tried as or�
dinary issues between plaintifffs. If on such trial the proper�
ty or effects of the defendant be found in the bands of the
ge.rni-,hee, the value thereof shall be assessed and judgment 
shall be rendered for the proper amount of money. If the
answer of the ~'ltrnishee be not excepted to or denied at the
same term at which it is filed, it shall be taken to be true and
sufficient. 
� 2711. If, by the answer not excepted to nor denied. it
shall appear that the gurnishoe is possessed of property or
effects of the defendant, or is indebted to the defendant, the
value of the property or effects, or of the debt, being ascer� 
tained, judgment may be rendered against the garnishee.
� 2712. In all cases of controversy between the plaintifff 
and garnishee, the parties may be adjudged to pay or recover
costs as in ordinary cases between plaintifff and defendant, 
~ 27rn. Any person wishing to sue his debtor by attach�
ment, where the debt or sum claimed exceeds the sum of one 
hundred dollars, may do so by first tiling with the clerk of
the district court of the county in which the debtor lives, or
before the clerk of the probate court of the county in which
the suit is brought, an affidavit and bond, as now required to
be done before the clerk of the district court, which shall
authorize the clerk before whom said affidavit and bond shall
be filed to issue writs of attachment, the same as clerks of
the district court: which attachment, together with the affi�
davit and bond, when issued by clerks of the probate court,
shall be by them made returnable to the next term of the dis�
trict court for the proper county, and shall be by them re�
turned to said district court on or before the first day of said
term.

�the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a fine not exceed�
ing two hundred and fifty dollars upon every snch officer or
member of such bod v or board: such fine, when collected, shall
be paid into the ter1~itorial treasury,' and the payment of such

original jurisdiction, and in such case the suprpme court or a
judge thereof shall first make a rule, returnable in term, that
such district court or judge thereof, show cause before the
court why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue,
and upon the return day of such rule such district court or
[udge may show cause against tho rule by affidavit or record
evidence, and upon the hearing- thereof, the supreme court 
shall award a peremptory writ, or dismiss the rule. In case
of emergency, a judg-e of the supremo court, at the time of 
making the rule to show cause, may also appoint a special
term of the court for hearing the motion, and at which the

court and party, or officer to whom it is directed, to desist
and refrain from any other proceedings in the action or mat-
ter specified therein, until the next term of said supreme
court, or the further order of the court thereon; and to show

party or officer to whom it is directed, in the same manner as

matters therein contained as sufficient cause why such court
should not be restrained, as mentioned in said writ, such
party shall thenceforth be deemed the defendant in such pro�

And in case the said arbitrators, or amicable auditors, shall
not agree in their decision, that they select an umpire, who 
shall vote in favor of the opinion that he may think most just
and right for the said arbitrators, to which decision or ami�
cable settlement we obligate ourselves to abide, and that for 
no reason whatever. although it might otherwise be admissi�
ble, shall we ask for reduction, exception, or appeal, nor make
other claim for the whole or any part thereof: thereforee, by
these presents we do now approve in all its parts, renouncing
the aid of tho laws; and we desire, and it is our will, that it be
executed without any delay. 
In testimony whereof we have hereunto set our hands and

upon the matter submitted to their inspection shaJl be car�
