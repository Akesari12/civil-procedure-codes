are of two kinds : ht, of law ; 2d, of fact, 
Ssc, 299-l. An issue of fact arises, I. Upon a material allegation 
of fact in the petition denied by the answer, 2. Upon a material alle�
gntion of fact in a set-off eounter-clnim, or cross-demand, presented in

Ssc. 2996. fames both of Jaw and fact may arise upon different
parts of the pleadings in the AA111e action. In such cases the issues of

refer the same, and may in either case accept or reject the finding of the 
jury or referee, and may, with or without a statement of nny finding of
facts, render such judgment as he considers equitable. While in a trial
by the second method, either party shall be entitled to have the whole
issue or ru:iy part thereof, OT aoy specific question of fact involved therein,
tried by R jury, under the instructions of the court, as in a case by OT� 
dinary proceedings, or to have the same tried by the court acting as a
jury, and flnding in writing the facts, which finding of facts in either
ease ~hull be of ultimate facts and not of evidence of such facts, and

facts so found as herein conrernplnted,
8. Al! to what is triable on appeal, In an appeal taken on a case 
tried in the firilt method, rdl the evidence shall go lo the supreme court,

go to the supreme court, except such as may be necessary to explain and
apply any bill of exceptions, and such court shall try only the legal
errors thereof, duly presented, as in a case by ordinary proceedings, in�
