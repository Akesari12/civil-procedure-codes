more
defendants,

of
all,
and the
separate
property
of the
defendants
served,
and if
they

the
persons
of
the
de
fendants
served; or,
2. If the action be
against
defendants
severally liable,
lie

against
the
defendants served, in the
same manner
as if
they
were the
only
defendants.
3. If all
the
defendants have
been served,
judgment may
betaken
against
any
or
either of them
severally,
when the
plaintifff
would
be en
titled to
judgment against
such
defendant
or
defendants,
if the action
had
been
against
them,
or
any
of them
alone.
4. If
the name
of one or more
partners
shall,
for
any
cause,
have been
omitted in
any
action
in
which
judgment
shall
have
passed
against
the
defendants named in the
summons,
and'such omission shall not have
been
pleaded
in
such
action,
the
plaintifff,
in
case the
judgment
therein
shall re
main
unsatisfied,
may
by
action recover
of such
partner separately, upon
proving
his
joint
liability,
notwithstanding
he
may
not have
been named
in the
original action;
but
the
plaintifff
shall
have satisfaction of
only
one
judgment
rendered for the same cause
of action.

there be several
parties
united in
interest,
and

that of his
agent
or
attorney,

other
act, a certified
copy
of the
judgment
may
be
served
upon
the
party
against
whom it is
given,
or the
person
or
officer
who
is
required
thereby
or
by
law to
obey
the
same,
and
his obedience
thereto enforced. If
he
refuse,
he
may
be
punished by
the com t
as for
contempt.
309.
Kinds
of

may
be

of
any county
where the
judgment

When
it
requires
the
delivery
of
real or
personal property,
it must be issued to
the sheriff
of
the
county
where the
property
or some
part
thereof is
situated. Execu
tions
may
be issued at
the
same time to different
counties. Real
property
adjudged
to
be sold
must be
sold in the
county
where it
lies,
by
the sher
iff
of such
county,
or
by
a referee

pur
pose,
and
thereupon
the sheriff or referee must execute
a
certificate of sale
to
the
purchaser
as hereinafter
provided.
An execution
may

against
a
married
woman,

the
jurisdiction
of the

person
of a
judgment
debtor,

Judgment
on
report

of.]
The court
may
confirm,
change,
modify,
or
set aside,
the
report,
and if
necessary,
appoint
new
referees.
Upon
the
report
being
confirmed,
judgment
must be rendered that such
partition
be
effectual
forever,
which
judgment
is
binding
and conclusive:
1.
On
all
persons
named
as
parties
to
the
action,
and their
legal
repre
sentatives,
who have
at the time
any
interest in
the
property
divided,
or
any part
thereof,
as owners in
fee,
or as tenants for
life,
or for
years,
or as
entitled to the
reversion,
remainder,
or the inheritance
of such
property,
therein,
and
who
by
any
contingency
may
be entitled to a
beneiicial in the
prop
or
any
part
thereof,
after the determination
of
a
particular
estate
erty,
or who have an
interest
in
any
undivided
share
thereof
as tenants
for
years
or for life.
2.
On
all
persons
interested
in the
property,
who
may
be
unknown,
to
whom notice has been
given
in the action for
partition
by
publication.
3.
On
all other
persons
claiming
from such
parties
or
persons,
or
either
of
them.
And no
judgment
is invalidated
by
reason
of the
death of
any
party
before
final
judgment
or
decree;
but such
judgment
or
decree
is as
conclu
sive
against
the
heirs, legal
representatives,
or
assigns,
of
such
decedent
as
if it had been
entered
before his death.
563. Tenants
not
affected.]
The
judgment
does not affect
tenants
for
years,
less than
ten,
to
the
whole
of the
property
which is the
subject
of the
partition.
564.
Payment
of
expenses.]
The
expenses
of
the
referees,
including
those
of a
surveyor
and
his
assistants,
when
employed,
must be
ascer
tained and
allowed
by
the
court,
and
the amount
thereof
together
with
the fees
allowed
by
the
court,
in its
discretion,
to the
referees,
must be
ap
portioned

the
different
parties

When
a lien
is on an

parties,
such

if a

be made,
shall
thenceforth be a
charge
only
on the share
assigned
to
such
party;
but
such
share must first be
charged
with
its
just
proportion
of
the
costs
of the
partition,
in
preference
to such
lien.
When
a
part
of the
property only
is
ordered
to be
sold,
if
there
be an
estate for life
or
years,
in an
undivided
share
of the

The
proceeds
of the

of the
general

2.
To

Whenever
any
party
to an
ac
tion
who
holds a lien
upon
the
property,
or
any part
thereof, has
other
securities
for the
payment
of the
amount
of such
lien,
the court
may,
in
its
discretion,
order such
security
to be exhausted before distribution of
the
proceeds
of
sale,
or
may
order a
just
deduction to
be
made
from the
amount of the lien
on
the
property
on account thereof.
569.
Distribution
by
referee.]
The
proceeds
of sale and the
securi
ties
taken
by
the
referees,
or
any part
thereof,
must be
distributed
by
them to the
persons
entitled
thereto,
whenever the court so directs.
But
in case no
direction
be
given,

of the sale of
any
share
or
parcel
belonging
to
persons
who are

court, the action
may
be
continued
as be
tween such
parties,
for the determination of their
respective
claims
thereto,
which
must be
ascertained and
adjudged
by
the court. Further
testimony
may
be taken in

700.
Jury
may
assess
damages.]
If an answer
be
made,
which raises
a
question
as
to a
matter
of fact essential to the determination
of the
motion,
and
affecting
the substantial
rights
of the
parties,
and
upon
the
supposed
truth of which
allegation
the
application
for the writ is
based,
the court
may,
in
its
discretion,
order the
question
to be
tried before
a
jury,

of
proof.] On the trial the
applicant
is not
precluded
by
the answer from
any
valid
objection

either in
direct denial or
by way
of avoidance.
702.
New
trial.]

in the
court in which the issue of
fact
is
made.
703. Transmission
of
verdict.]
If
no notice of a motion for
a new trial
be
given,
or,
if
given,
the motion be
denied,

within five
days
after rendition of
the verdict or denial of the
motion,
must transmit
to the
court in
which
the
application
for the
writ is
pending,
a
certified
copy
of
the verdict
attached to the order of
trial,
after
which either
party
may
bring
on the
argument
of
the
application, upon
reasonable notice
to the
adverse
party.
704.
Hearing.]
If no answer
be
made,
the case must be
heard on the
papers
of the
applicant.
If
the
answer raises
only questions
of
law,
or
puts
in
issue
only
immaterial
statements,
not
affecting
the substantial
rights
of
the
parties,
the court
must
proceed
to
hear,
or fix a
day

ing,

by
the court or
referee,
upon
a reference
to be
ordered,
together
with
costs;
and for such
damages
and
costs exe
cution

peremptory
mandamus
must
also
be
awarded
without
delay.
706. Service
upon
majority
of
hoard.]

the
same manner as summons in a
civil
action,
except
when otherwise ex
pressly
directed
by
order of the
court.
Service

a
majority
of the
members
of
any
board or
body
is service

the
board or
body,
whether
at the time of the service
the board was in
session or not.

a
peremptory
mandamus
has
been
issued and directed to
any
inferior
tribunal,
corporation,
board or
person,
if
it
appear
to the
court
that
any
member
of
such
tribunal,
corpora
tion,
board or such
person
upon
whom the writ has been
personally
has,
without
just
excuse,
refused
or
neglected
to
obey
the
same,
the
court
may,
upon
motion,
impose
a
tine not
exceeding
one thousand dollars. In
case of
persistence
in
a refusal
of
obedience,
the
court
may
order the
party
to be
imprisoned
until the writ is
obeyed,

Every
executor
or
administrator
must
make and return to the
court,
at its first term after his
appointment,
a
true
inventory
and
appraisement
of all the
estate
of the
decedent,
except
the
homestead,
if
any,
which has come to his
possession
or
knowledge.

of estate.
To
make
the
appraisement,
the
judge
must
appoint
three
disinterested
persons,
any
of
whom
may
act,
who are
entitled to receive a reasonable
compensation
for
their
services,
not to exceed
two dollars
per
day,
to
be
allowed
by
the court. The
ap
praisers
must,
with the
inventory,
file
a verified account of their
services
and
disbursements. If
any part
of the
estate
is
in
any
other
county,
the
same
appraisers may
proceed
to view and
appraise
the
same,
or
other
appraisers
in
that
county
may
be
appointed
to
perform
that
duty,
by
the
judge
of
the
probate
court
of the
county
in which the letters were
issued,
as he
may
deem best,
and the
like
report
must be made in each
case
di
rect
to
the
probate
court
of the
county
which
issued the letters.
115.
Oath
inventory
contents.]
Before
proceeding
to
the
execution
of
their
duty,
the
appraisers
must
take and subscribe
an
oath,
to be at
tached to the
inventory,
that
they
will
truly,
honestly
and
impartially
ap
praise
the
property
exhibited to them,
according
to the best of their
knowledge
and
ability.
They
must
then
proceed
to estimate and
appraise
the
property;
each article
must be set down
separately,
with the value
thereof in
dollars
and cents,
in
figures,
opposite
to the articles
respec
tively;
the
inventory
must
contain all the estate
of
the decedent,
real and
personal,
except
the homestead, a statement
of all
debts,
partnerships
and other
interests,
bonds,
mortgages,
notes and other securities
for
the
payment
of
money
belonging
to the
decedent,
specifying
the name
of the
debtor in each
security,
the
date,
the sum
originally
payable,
the indorse
ments
thereon,
if
any,
with
their
dates,
and
the
sum
which,
in the
judg
ment of the
appraisers,
may
be collected
on
each
debt,
interest
or
security.
116.
Money
received.]
The
inventory
must also contain
an account
of all
monies
belonging
to the decedent
which
have
come to the hands
of
the executor or
administrator,
and if
none,
the fact must be so stated
in
the
inventory.
If the whole estate consists of
money,
there
need
not be
an
appraisement,
but an
inventory
must be made and returned as
in other
cases.
117. Executor's
personal
debt.]
The
naming
of a
person
as executor
does not
thereby discharge
him from
any
just
claim
which the
testator
has
against
him,
but the claim must be included in the
inventory,
and
the ex
ecutor is liable for
the
same,
as
for
so much
money
in his
hands,
when the
debt or demand becomes due.
118.
Bequest
to
construed.]
The
discharge
or
bequest
in a
will
of
any
debt
or
demand of the
testator
against
the
executor
named,
or
any
other
person,
is
not
valid
against
the creditors of the
decedent,
but
is a
specific
bequest
of the debt or
demand.
It
must be included
in the
inven
tory,
and, if
necessary,
applied
in the
payment
of the debts. If
not neces
sary
for that
purpose,
it
must be
paid
in the
same manner
and
propor
tion
as other
specific legacies.
119. Return
of
inventory.]
The
inventory
must
be signed
by
the
ap
praisers,
and the executor or
administrator must
take and subscribe
an
oath,
before
an
officer authorized to administer
oaths,
that the
inventory
contains a true
statement of all the estate of the decedent
which
has
come
to
his
knowledge
and
possession,
and
particularly
of
all
money
belonging
to the
decedent,
and of all
just
claims of the
decedent
against
the affiant.
The
oath
must be indorsed
upon
or annexed to the
inventory.
120.
Refusal
revocation.]
If an executor or administrator
neglects
or
refuses
to
return the
inventory
within
the
time
prescribed,
or within
such
further
time,
not
exceeding
two
months,
which the
judge
shall,
for a
reasonable
cause,
allow,
the court
may,
upon
notice, revoke the letters
testamentary
or of
administration,
and the
executor or administrator
is
liable on
his bond for
any
injury
to the
estate, or
any person
interested
therein,
arising
from
such
failure.
121. Additional
inventory.]
Whenever
property
not mentioned
in an
inventory
that is
made
and
filed,
comes to the
possession
or
knowledge
of
an
executor or
administrator,
he must
cause the same to be
appraised
in
the
manner
prescribed
in this
article,
and an
inventory
thereof
to be
returned
within two months after the
discovery,
and the
making
of such
inventory
may
be
enforced,
after
notice,
by
attachment
or
removal from
office.

which contain evidences

any
real
or
personal
estate,
or
any
claim
or
demand,
or
any

the
judge
may

court,
and
may

him,
on

upon
the matter of such

if he can
be
found
in the
territory.
But if
cited from another
county,
and he
appears
and
is found innocent,
his
necessary expenses
mus-t be allowed
him out of
the estate.

the

requiring
such

and
all such

tories and
answers must be in

any
executor or
administrator, may

that
the
estate
is
r
solvent,
it
shall
be the
duty
of the said
court to allow the
said sums
so
paid
in
the settlement of said
accounts.
143.
Claim
by
probate
judge.]
Any
judge
of the
probate
court
may
present
a claim
against
the estate of
a
decedent,
for
allowance,
to
the ex
ecutor or
administrator
thereof: and if
the executor or administrator
allows or
rejects
the
claim,
he
must, in
writing,
present
the same
to the
county
clerk of the
county,
who shall
thereupon
be
substituted
in the
set
tlement of said
estate
in
place
of the
probate
judge,
as
provided
by
law,
and the
judge
of
the
probate
court
presenting
such
claim,
in case of
its
rejection
by
the executor or
administrator,
or
by
such
county
as
judge,
has the same
right
to sue in a
proper
court for its
recovery
as
other
persons
have when their claims
against
an
estate are
rejected.
144.

he must indorse thereon
his allowance or
rejection,
with the
day
and date thereof. If he allow the
claim,
it must be
presented
to
the
judge
for
his
approval,
who
must,
in the same
manner,
indorse
upon
it
his allowance or
rejection.
If the executor or
administrator,
or the
judge
refuse or
neglect
to indorse such
allowance or
rejection
for
ten
days
after
the claim has been
presented
to
him,
such refusal or
neglect
is
equivalent
to a
rejection
on the
tenth
day;
and if
the
presentation
be
made
by
a
notary,
the certificate of such
notary,
under
seal,
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
such
presentation
and
rejection.
If the
claim
be
presented
to the
execu
tor or administrator before the
expiration
of the time limited for
the
pre
sentation
of
claims,
the same
is
presented
in
time,
though
acted
upon by
the executor or
administrator,
and
by
the
judge,
after the
expiration
of
such time.
145.
Claims
filed in

within
thirty days
thereafter,
be filed in the
probate
court,

in
due course of administration.
If
the
claim
is founded
on
a
bond,
bill,
note,
or
any
other
instrument,
a
copy
of such instrument
must accom
pany
the
claim,
and the
original
instrument
must be

in which
case the claimant must
accompany
his
claim
by
his
affidavit,
containing
a
copy
or
particular
description
of
such
instrument,
and
stating
its loss
or
destruction. If the
claim or
any
part
thereof is
secured
by
a
mortgage
or
other lien which has been recorded
or
filed
according
to law in the office
of
the
register
of deeds
of the
county
in which the
land affected
by
it
lies,
it is sufficient to describe the mort
gage
or
lien,
and refer to the date
of its
filing
and
volume,
and
page
of
its
record.
If,
in
any
case,
the claimant has left
any
original
voucher
in
the
hands of the executor or
administrator,
or suffered the same
to be
filed in
court,
he
may
withdraw
the same when a
copy
of the same has
been
already,
or is
then,
attached
to
his claim. A brief
description
of
every
claim filed
must be
entered
by
the
judge
in the
register,
showing
the
name of the
claimant,
the amount and character of the
claim,
rate of inter
est,
and
date of allowance.
146.

of the
probate
court,
the

must
bring
suit in the
proper

he
may,

Presentment
required.]
No
holder of
any

against
an

tate shall
maintain
any
action
thereon,
unless the claim
is first
presented
to the
executor or administrator.
149.
Vacancy
in
administration.]
The time
during
which there
shall
be a
vacancy
in
the
administration,
must not be
included
in
any

his claim to the executor or
administrator,
for allowance or
rejection,
authenticated as
required
in other
cases;
and no
recovery
shall
be
had
in
the
action
unless
proof
be made of the
presentation required.
151. Partial
allowance.]
Whenever
any
claim is
presented
to
an
executor or
administrator,
or to the
judge
of the
probate
court,
and
he is
willing
to allow the same in
part,
he must state
in his
indorsement
the
amount he is
willing
to
allow.
If the creditor
refuse to
accept
the amount
allowed in
satisfaction
of his
claim,
he shall recover
no
costs
in
an
action
therefore,
brought
against
the
executor
or
administrator,
unless
he recovers
a
greater
amount
than that
offered
to be allowed.
152.
Effect
of
judgment.]
A
judgment
rendered
against
an executor
or
administrator
in the district court or before a
magistrate, upon
any
claim
for
money
against
the estate of his testator or
intestate,
only
estab
lishes
the
claim in the same manner
as
if it had been allowed
by
the
executor or administrator and the
judge
of the
probate
court,
and
the
judgment must
be that the executor or administrator
pay,
in due
course
of
administration,
the amount ascertained to be due. A
certified trans
cript
of
the
judgment
must
be filed in the
probate
court. No
execution
must
issue
upon
such
judgment,
nor
shall it create
any
lien
upon
the
property
of the estate
or
give
to the
judgment
creditor
any
priority
of
payment.
153.
Judgments
before
death
how
collected.]
When
any
judgment
has
been
rendered
for or
against
the testator or intestate
in his
lifetime,
no
execution shall
issue
thereon after
his
death,
except:
1.
In
case of the
death
of the
judgment
creditor,
upon
the
application
of
his
executor or
administrator,
or
successor
in interests.
2.
In
case of the death of the
judgment
debtor,
if
the
judgment
be for
the
recovery
of real
or
personal
property,
or the enforcement
of
a lien
thereon.
A
judgment
against
the decedent
for
the
recovery
of
money,
must
be
presented
to the executor
or
administrator,
like
any
other claim.
If the
execution
is
actually
levied
upon
any property
of the decedent before
his
death, the same
may
be sold
for
the satisfaction
thereof,
and the officer
making
the sale must account
to the
executor
or administrator
for
any
surplus
in his
hands.
154. Death
after
verdict.]
A
judgment
rendered
against
a
decedent,
dying
after
verdict or decision on an issue
of
fact,
but before
judgment
is
rendered thereon, is
not a lien on the real
property
of the
decedent,
but
is
payable
in due
course of administration.
155.
Reference
of
claim.]
If the
executor or administrator
doubts
the correctness of
any
claim
presented
to
him,
he
may
enter into
an
agreement,
in
writing,
with the
claimant,
to
refer the matter in contro
versy
to
some disinterested
person,
to be
approved by
the
judge
of the
probate
court,
upon riling
the
agreement
and
approval
of
the
judge
of the
probate
court,
in the office of
the clerk of the district court for the
county,
or
judicial
subdivision,
in which the letters
testamentary
or
of adminis
tration were
granted,
the
clerk
must,
either in vacation or in
term,
enter a
minute of
the
order
referring
the matter
in
controversy
to
the
person
so
selected;
or,
if the
parties
consent,
a reference
may
be had in the
probate
court;
and the
report
of the
referee,
if
confirmed,
establishes
or
claim,
the same
as if it had
been allowed or
rejected by
the executor or
administrator
and the
probate judge.
The referee

judgment
of
the
court theron shall be as valid
and effect
ual,
in all
respects,
as if the
same had
been rendered in a suit
commenced
by ordinary
process.
157.
Costs
against
representative.]
When
a
judgment
is
recovered,
with
costs,
against
any
executor or
administrator,
he
shall
be
individually
liable for such
costs,
but
they
must be
allowed
him
in his administration
accounts,
unless it
appears
that the
suit or
proceeding
in which
the
costs
were taxed was
prosecuted
or
defended without
just
cause.

be
paid
as other
claims,
in due
course
of
administration.
If,
however,
the
judge
rejects
the
claim,
action thereon
may
be had
against
the
estate
by
the
claimant,
and
summons must be served
upon
the
judge
of the
probate
court,
who
may
appoint
an
attorney
at the
expense
of the
estate,
to de

by
his
will,

specific
devises
or
legacies
are
ex

it
appears
to the court
necessary

The

allowance
thereof

the court must make an order for the

the

estate
require.
If there be not sufficient
funds
in the

the

When a decree

creditors,
the executor or

is
personally
liable
to each
creditor for his allowed
claim,

the

thereon,

may
be issued
on
such
decrees,

in the

of
each
creditor,
and
the same
proceeding
may
be
had under such
execution
as
if it
had been issued from the
district
court. The
executor
or administrator is
liable therefore,
on
his
bond,
to
each creditor.
265. Other
liability.]
When the accounts of the
administrator
or
executor
have been
settled,
and an order made for
the
payment,
of
debts
and
distribution of the
estate,
no
creditor whose claim
was not
included
in
the
order for
payment
has
any
right
to call
upon
the
creditors who
have
been
paid,
or
upon
the
heirs,
devisees,
or
legatees,
to
contribute to
the
payment
of his
claim;
but if
the
executor
or
administrator has
failed to
give
the notice to creditors as
required
in the
first and second
sections of
chapter
VI,
such creditor
may
recover
on
the bond of the
executor or
ad
ministrator the amount of his
claim,
or such
part
thereof as he would
have
been
entitled to
had
it been
allowed. This section shall not
apply
to
any
creditor
whose
claim was not due
ten
months before the
day
of
settlement,
or
whose claim was
contingent
and did not become
absolute ten
months
before

If the whole of the debts have

the

on
the
petition
of
any person
interested. But
before
commissioners are
appointed,
or

ordered
by
the
probate

directed in this
subdivision,
notice thereof must be
given
to all
persons
in
terested,

Realty
in different
counties.]
If the
real estate is in different
counties,
the
probate
court
may,
if
deemed
proper, appoint
commissioners
for
all,
or different commissioners for each
county.
The whole
estate,
whether in
one or more counties, shall be divided
among
the
heirs,
devisees, or
legatees
as
if it
were
all in one
county,
and the
commissioners
must,
unless
otherwise directed
by
the
probate
court,
make
division of
such
real
estate,
wherever situated within
this
territory.
282.
When
part
conveyed.]
Partition or distribution of the real
estate
may
be made
as
provided
in this
chapter,
although
some
of
the
original
heirs, legatees,
or
devisees
may
have
conveyed
their
shares
to
other
persons,
and such
shares must be
assigned
to
the
person
holding
the
same,
in the
same
manner
as
they
otherwise
would*
have
been to
such heirs,
legatees,
or devisees.
28'5. How
shakes
set
apart.]
When
both distribution and
partition
are
made,
the several
shares in the real
and
personal
estate must be'
set
out to
each individual in
proportion
to
his
right,
by
metes and
bounds,
or
description,
so
that the same can be
easily distinguished,
unless two or
more of
the
parties
interested
consent to have
their shares
set out so as
to be
held
by
them
in common and undivided.

When
the
real

prejudice
or inconvenience to the
owners,
the
probate
court
may
assign

more of the
parties
en
titled to

therein,
who will
accept
it,
always
preferring
the males
to
the
females, and
among
children
preferring
the elder to
the
younger.
The

accepting
the

pay
to the
other
parties
interested their
just
proportion
of the true value thereof,
or secure the same
to their satis
faction,
or,
in case
of
the
minority
of such
party,
then to
the satisfaction
of his
guardian,
and the true
value of the estate
must be ascertained
and
reported
by
the
commissioners.
When
the commissioners
appointed
to
make
partition
are of
the
opinion
that the real estate
cannot be divided
without,
prejudice
or inconvenience to the
owners,
they
must so
report
to

and recommend
that
the whole be

Parties

The
plaintifff
in the
probate
court shall be the
plaintifff
in the district
court;
and when the
ap
peal
is
on
questions
of law
alone,
the
appellate
court
may
reverse, affirm
or
modify
the
judgment,
decree or
order,
or the
part
thereof
appealed
from,
and
every
intermediate order
which
it
is
authorized
by
law to re
view,
in
any
respect
mentioned
in the notice of
appeal,
and as to
any
or
all
of the
parties,
and it
may
order a
new
hearing. Upon
such
appeal,
so
much
of the
evidence
as
may
be
necessary
to
explain
the
grounds,
and no
more,
may
be
certified into the
appellate
court.
320. Trial
de novo
of fact
by
court.]
When the
appeal
is
on
ques
tions of
fact,
or
on
questions
of both law and
fact,
the trial in the district
court must be de
novo,
and shall be conducted in
the same
manner
as
if
the case and
proceedings
had
lawfully
originated
in
that
court;
and such
appellate
court has
the
same
power
to
decide the
questions
of
fact which
the
probate
court,
or
judge,
had;
and it
may,
in
its
discretion,
as
in suits
in
chancery,
and
with like
effect,
make an
order for the trial
by
a
jury
of
any
or
all
the material
questions
of
fact,
arising
upon
the
issues between
the
parties;
and such
an
order
must
state
distinctly
and
plainly
the
ques
tions of fact to be tried.
327.
Neglect
of
probate
record.]
If the
judge
of the
probate
conrt
neglect
or refuse to make or
transmit such certified
copies
as
are herein
before
required
to
be
transmitted to the clerk of the district
court
in
cases
of
appeal,
he
may
be
compelled
by
the district court
by
an
order
upon
motion,
to do
so,
and he
may
be
fined as for
contempt
for
any
such
neglect
or refusal.
A certified
copy
of such order
may
be
served
upon
the
probate judge by
the
party
or his
attorney.
The dismissal of an

Costs
how
payable.]
Such
appellate
court
may
award
to
the
successful
party
the costs of the
appeal;
or it
may
direct that
such
costs
abide the event
of a new
hearing,
or of the
subsequent
proceedings
in the

court. In either
case,
the
costs
may
be made
payable
out
of the
estate
or

or
personally by
the
unsuccessful
party,
as directed
by
the
appellate
court;
or,
if no such direction be
given,
as
directed
by
the
pro
bate court.

Enforcement
by
probate
court.]
When a
judgment,
decree
or
order,
from
which an
appeal
has
been
taken,
is
wholly
or
partly
affirmed,
or is modified
by
the
judgment
rendered
by
the district
court
upon
such
appeal,
it must be
enforced,
to the extent authorized
by
the
latter
judg
ment,
by
the
probate
court, in like manner as if
no
appeal
therefrom
had
been
taken;
and the district court must
direct
the
proceedings
to be remit
ted for
that
purpose
to the
probate
court,
or
to
the
judge
thereof.
331. Official
bonds
good
on
appeal.]
When an
executor or adminis

given
an
official bond

judgment,
decree or
order,
of the
probate
court or
judge,
made in
the
proceedings
had
upon
the estate
of which he
is administrator
or
executor,
his said
bond stands
in the
place
of
an
appeal
bond,
and the
sureties
therein are liable as
on
such
appeal
bond.
332. Lawful
acts valid
when.]
When the
order or decree
appoint
ing
an
executor,
or
administrator,
or
guardian,
is reversed
on

sureties,
in
the sum of one hundred
dollars,
for the
payment
of
the
costs on
the
appeal;
or,
if a
stay
of
proceedings
be
claimed,
in a
sum
equal
to
twice the amount of the
judgment, including
costs, when the
judgment
is for the
payment
of
money;
or twice the value of
the
property,
including
costs,
when the
judgment
is for the
recovery
of
specific
personal
property,
and must be
conditioned;
when the
action is
for
the
recovery
of
money,
that
the
appellant
will
pay
the amount of the
judgment appealed
from and
all costs;
if the
appeal
be
withdrawn or
dismissed,
or the amount of
any
judgment
and all costs
that
may
be recovered
against
him
in the
action
in the
district court. When
the action
is

obey
the order of the

made
therein,

any
judgment
and
costs that

any
order made
by

the amount
of the
judgment,
including
all costs
appealed
from,
or of the
value of the
property,
including
all costs
in
actions
for the
recovery
of
specific
personal property,
with the
justice,
is
equivalent
to
the
filing
of
the
undertaking;
and
in such
cases
the
justice
must
transmit
the
money
to
the clerk of the district
court,
to be
by
him
paid
out on the order of the
court. The adverse
party
may
except
to the
sufficiency
of
the
sureties
within
five
days
after the
filing
of the
undertaking,
and unless
they
or
other sureties
justify
before the
justice
before whom the
appeal
is
taken,
within five
days
thereafter,
upon
notice
to
the adverse
party,
to the
amounts
stated in their
affidavits,
the
appeal
must be
regarded
as
if no
such
undertaking
had been
given.
