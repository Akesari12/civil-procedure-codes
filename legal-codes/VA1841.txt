the estate of such defendant or defendants, returnable to the next succeeding 
court, and upon the eecution and return of such attachment, the court shall 
order the estate seized, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to satisfy the
judgment and costs, and all costs accruing under the attachment, to be sold as

process, with an endorsement of the execution of such first process, and the
name of the appearance bail, if any was taken; and shall also return a copy

copy thereof with the wife of the defendant, or some free white person above
the age of sixteen years, then and there being one of the family of the defendant, and found at his usual place of abode, or to leave a copy thereof at such

been filed therein.(q) Re, 1819.
