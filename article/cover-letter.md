Dear Dr. Lichtenstein and AHR editors,

Kellen Funk and I would like to submit an article titled "The Spine of American Law: Digital History Methods and U.S. Legal Practice." We would appreciate it if you would consider it for publication in the American Historical Review.

We think that this article is suitable to the publication aims of the AHR for two reasons. First, the article demonstrates how the methods of text analysis can be used for historical arguments. Historians have been generally reluctant to take up computational analysis of texts despite, as Lara Putnam explained in her AHR article this year, the widespread availability of digitized texts. We think this reluctance to use text analysis is in part because historians have not known how to connect that method to specific research questions likely to produce historical arguments. We both model and explain how text analysis can serve a historian's purpose, and so our article takes up the other half of the question that Putnam considered. 

Second, we use our method to reconsider in a fundamental way how law was created and the implications of law for the history of American capitalism. We show how state commissions borrowed codes of civil procedure from one another in the nineteenth-century United States, a pattern of borrowing which we call the spine of American law. Legal historians of Reconstruction have focused primarily on civil rights and the creation of a national state. This article shows that during those same decades many local legal institutions and practices were transformed not by federal power but by state codification. Challenging the supposed equality of the states that underlies scholarship on American federalism, this article argues that New York lived up to its pretensions to being an "empire state" by the promulgation of its legal code among an economic periphery of American states. Seemingly innocuous codes of "procedure" or regulations of legal "practice" had far-reaching consequences and stoked major political debates. By regulating the timing, scope, and means of proof for civil remedies, the New York Code effectively swapped the legal and economic rhythms of agriculture for those of merchant finance. 

We have included the manuscript in a Word document as requested. But because some of the figures and tables may not properly display on every computer, we have also attached a PDF. Of course should you accept the manuscript, we can provide the figures in whatever format you require.

Thank you for considering this article.

All the best,
Lincoln Mullen
Kellen Funk
